<p>Like malicious magicians, scammers use distractions and illusions to keep you from figuring out their tricks. They know if they can’t keep up the facade, you’ll realize it’s fishy. Many of the common techniques of scams – like urgency and rushing your decision – are really ways to hijack your decision-making brain and keep you focused on their lies. But by understanding how our brains work and how scammers manipulate it, you can spot their scam methods before they fool you.</p>



<script async="" data-type="track" data-hash="32XDRaOgO0" data-track="182" src="https://app.fusebox.fm/embed/player.js"></script><br>



<p><em>See </em><a href="https://www.easyprey.com/why-we-fall-for-scams-with-chris-chabris-and-dan-simons/"><em>Why We Fall for Scams with Chris Chabris and Dan Simons</em></a><em> for a complete transcript of the Easy Prey podcast episode.</em></p>



<p>Dan Simons and Christopher Chabris have jointly authored two books and multiple essays about human decision-making, distraction, and why are brains are vulnerable to scammers’ tricks, including the recent release <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3OLhw9D">Nobody’s Fool: Why We Get Taken In and What We Can Do About It</a></em>. Dan is a professor of psychology at the University of Illinois. Most of his research is around visual attention, what we notice, what we miss, and how we focus our attention. He also has a broad interest in how we think about perception and how we think about how our minds work. Chris is a cognitive scientist. He has a day job working for a health system in Pennsylvania, where he is also a professor and involved in work helping people make better decisions. His work applies ideas from decision science and cognitive psychology to improve people’s decision-making.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-they-wrote-a-book-about-scam-methods">Why They Wrote a Book About Scam Methods</h2>



<p>Dan and Chris started thinking about this topic a long time ago. They finished thier first book together over a decade ago. For their second book, they started by gathering content and generating ideas of what they wanted to write about. Most of what they came up with had to do with deception in general. It took them a while to find a way to organize all the ideas into a connected, cohesive book.</p>



<p>They found the connection when they realized that across all the different domains they looked at – chess, art, science, sports, and more – scams, cons, deception, and self-deception all had common characteristics. The scam methods relied on thought patterns that normally work well, but can be distorted by people trying to deceive us. Information that we find appealing can be hijacked to lead us down the wrong path.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>[Scams] rely on the same sorts of thought patterns that we tend to use very effectively most of the time, but they get distorted at times by people trying to decieve us. </p>
<cite>Dan Simons</cite></blockquote>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-stories-of-deception">Stories of Deception</h3>



<p>One of the interesting things they found when trying to structure the book was that all the stories about cons were engaging and entertaining. They have a narrative structure – which is why movies about big cons are popular. There are hundreds of news stories, <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/the-tinder-swindler-victim-story">documentaries</a>, podcasts, and more about these types of deceptions.</p>



<p>One case that comes to mind for Chris is his father. His father lived to be ninety-seven years old. Sometimes late in life, he got a call from a guy pretending to be a tech support person who needed to help him fix his internet. Chris’s father was pretty savvy and cognitively intact until the end, so he hung up on them. His father was never victimized, but Chris could easily see how he or someone like him could have been.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" width="1024" height="683" src="https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1352168896-1024x683.jpg" alt="We've all heard stories about scams - so why are the same scam methods still tricking us?" class="wp-image-6225" srcset="https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1352168896-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1352168896-300x200.jpg 300w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1352168896-768x512.jpg 768w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1352168896-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1352168896-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Chances are high that you’ve heard a story about a scam, or at the very least watched a movie featuring one. But very few of these stories focus on why people get fooled. Why do some scam methods lead really smart, highly-educated people into scams? Stories of these kinds of cons are everywhere. And yet we’re seeing more and more news about scams and cons in all sorts of areas. Why aren’t we learning from all the movies and the true tales that end up in articles or podcasts? Dan and Chris wanted to explore this idea – and try to make us more aware of the risks in our own brains.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Whether that means there’s more and more [scams] happening, or we’re just leaning about more and more of it, it seems to be such an issue of great importance that it is worth diving into. </p>
<cite>Chris Chabris</cite></blockquote>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-scam-methods-in-movies-and-reality">Scam Methods in Movies and Reality</h3>



<p>The scam methods you see in movies about great cons are somewhat accurate. The fictional con artists exploit the same kinds of cognitive tendencies that make us vulnerable in real life. Most of the scam methods you see on the screen also work in real life.</p>



<p>What isn’t realistic is the intricacy of the plan and how everything depends on a precise sequence and exact timing. You need that kind of tension to make a compelling movie. And while some scams do run down to the wire to avoid getting caught, such as Bernie Madoff’s <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/ponzi-schemes-with-steve-weisman">Ponzi scheme</a>, most of them are much more flexible and don’t require precise timing.</p>



<p>Even huge cons like Madoff’s scheme, Theranos, and other long-running cons don’t need that level of precision. But they are good examples to think about because they draw on a variety of scam methods to keep going. They exploit the same metal habits and use other techniques available. Smaller scams may only need to rely on one or two scam methods, but for something to last as long as these examples, they need to take advantage of every trick in the book.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-scammer-who-targeted-academics">The Scammer Who Targeted Academics</h2>



<p>At one point, Chris and Dan were targeted by the same scammer. This was nearly twenty years ago. Chris was a postdoctoral researcher at Harvard, and he was contacted out of the blue by someone. This man seemed to know who Chris was and have a lot of connections in common. He told Chris about a person who had an interesting neurological problem and wondered if Chris was interested in doing a case study. Chris was interested. They had a number of phone calls back and forth and Chris was working to make the study happen when eventually, contact stopped.</p>



<p>Around the same time, Dan was contacted by the same person claiming to be interested in the work he was doing on visual perception. He was interested in illusions and wanted to find a way to make Dan’s research more well-known. Just like Chris, this man pitched a collaboration. At one point, he asked Dan to help work on his website, which Dan declined. They had multiple calls and emails over several months before contact stopped.</p>



<p>It was only very recently that Dan and Chris learned what happened. The man was a small-scale scammer. Most often he convinced people to let him sell their rare books and then never gave them the money. He affiliated himself with high-profile researchers and universities, and people kept him around thinking everyone else knew him even though nobody really did.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-one-easy-way-to-avoid-being-scammed">One Easy Way to Avoid Being Scammed</h3>



<p>This story illustrates one easy way some people can avoid being scammed. That method is to look up the person talking to you! Check their credentials and look up whether they have been convicted, criminally sued, professionally sanctioned, or anything else. A history of speeding tickets may not be relevant. But a lawsuit or conviction for scams, fraud, or relevant crimes definitely is. Surprisingly, many people don’t think to check. Scammers don’t usually change their scam methods. If they’ve done it before, chances are good that they’ll do it again.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Have they done the same thing before that they might do to you? That’s a really basic question to ask. </p>
<cite>Chris Chabris</cite></blockquote>



<p>For the scammer who reached out to Chris and Dan, they could have seen through him specifically by checking his credentials. He was academic-adjacent, but didn’t have the kind of credentials you would expect for someone in a research field. Scammers targeting academics often use scam methods to pass themselves off as wealthy connected patrons, which this scammer did sometimes. But he was faking a lot of his resources, too. His main tool was talking his way into things. He was more of a recreational or hobbyist scammer than a professional, so he didn’t have convictions to be suspicious. But the credentials would have been a warning sign if Dan or Chris had checked.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-scam-methods-exploit-your-focus">How Scam Methods Exploit Your Focus</h2>



<p>Humans only have the ability to focus on a select amount of information in front of us. This is what we commonly call “paying attention.” When you’re focusing on something, you can process information more efficiently and get more out of it. But it also means you have less focus for anything else. If you’re focused on what’s on your computer screen, you may not notice things happening elsewhere in the room.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>A good con artist, a good scammer, will know that if they can get you to focus on one thing, you may not notice something else. </p>
<cite>Chris Chabris</cite></blockquote>



<p>If a scammer can use their scam methods to get you to focus on what they want, they know you’ll be less likely to notice what they’re doing behind the scenes. It’s like a magic show. The magician directs your attention to what they want you to pay attention to and away from the slight of hand that makes the effect happen.</p>



<p>The challenge here is that focus is not a bad thing. The ability to focus on one thing and exclude everything else is really important and helpful in our everyday life. It only becomes a problem when scam artists exploit and manipulate it to their benefit.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-time-pressure-as-a-scam-method">Time Pressure as a Scam Method</h3>



<p>One of the most commonly-used scam methods is time pressure. It could be an “exploding offer” – something fantastic that will expire in a very short time. Or with <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/irs-scam">IRS scams</a> or other <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/social-security-scams-impostor-scams">impostor scams</a>, the scammer may claim that the police are on their way to arrest you and will be there in half an hour, but if you can pay your debt before they arrive they’ll call the police off.</p>



<p>Time pressure is a scam method that manipulates your focus. If the scammer can get you stuck in the moment, or in a rush to deal with the situation before the police arrive, it can be hard to step back and consider what you’re actually being told. Most of us know that the IRS will never call you and demand gift cards. But if the scammer can get you to focus only on what they’re saying and the time pressure, it may not even occur to you to ask what’s going on or if the request makes sense.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Time pressure is, in a way, a tactic to get you to focus. You don’t have time to consult alternate sources of information or think about what information is missing. </p>
<cite>Chris Chabris</cite></blockquote>



<p>Many other scam techniques, like staying on the phone with you while you drive to the store to buy gift cards, are just more attempts to manipulate your focus. They know if they stop talking to you, you might start to think about whether gift cards are actually a reasonable way to pay for this or if it’s normal for the Social Security Administration to threaten you with arrest. Time pressure, rapid-fire talking, and many other scam techniques are meant to keep your focus on the scammer, not what’s really happening.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-principle-of-prediction">The Principle of Prediction</h2>



<p>You’ve probably heard of confirmation bias before. With confirmation bias, people seek out evidence to confirm their expectations, beliefs, or conclusions about something. The principle of prediction is similar, but it’s also something that scam methods can exploit to swindle us.</p>



<p>“Prediction” refers to the fact that we tend to be much less critical of new information that matches what we expect. Most of us are really good at critical thinking when it comes to things we disagree with. If someone tells us something we absolutely don’t believe, we can tear it apart. But it’s much harder to find flaws in an argument when it’s something we believe or expect. Scammers know this, and they exploit prediction in their scam methods. They give you what you’re expecting or hoping for so it’s harder to counter it.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We’re capable of applying logic really effectively when it’s something we disagree with, but we tend not to apply it as systematically when it’s something we agree with. </p>
<cite>Dan Simons</cite></blockquote>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-prediction-works">How Prediction Works</h3>



<p>For example, it’s normally a good thing to trust people that you know. The longer you’ve known them, the better you know them, and the better you know them the more you can trust them. That’s how it works normally. But these days we have social media and “online friends.” When those friends spread information to us, our brains view it with a little extra credibility because it came from someone we know. Even if that credibility isn’t warranted – for example, your friend retweeted something from a complete stranger – we still view it as a bit more trustworthy. This creates pathways that scam methods can exploit.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1185903411-1024x683.jpg" alt="Scam methods exploit our natural human tendencies." class="wp-image-6224" srcset="https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1185903411-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1185903411-300x200.jpg 300w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1185903411-768x512.jpg 768w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1185903411-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1185903411-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>This tendency usually works really well. Most people don’t get scammed or conned all the time. The moment-to-moment risk is pretty low. Most of the time, these “shortcuts” or mental simplifications work really well for us. There’s a tendency to frame them as biases or flaws, but they’re not. We have these tendencies because in most cases, they work. But they can be hijacked for nefarious purposes or lead us astray if we assume they always work. That’s where it becomes a challenge.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>These are things that work really, really well most of the time and that can be hijacked for the wrong purposes. </p>
<cite>Dan Simons</cite></blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-commitments-and-assumptions">Commitments and Assumptions</h2>



<p>In this context, a “commitment” is an assumption that we make and that we hold to strongly. We often don’t realize we’ve made these commitments or hold them when we’re making a decision. The challenge with commitments is that if we accept them as inherently true, logic can lead us to all kinds of absurd conclusions because we have to rationalize other things to keep believing our commitment.</p>



<p>NXIVM was a <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/mlm-scams-manipulation">multi-level marketing</a> organization, front for criminal activity, and arguable cult founded by a guy who got himself in a book of records as the world’s smartest man. One early member wrote in a memoir that she knew he was the world’s smartest man, so whatever he said had to be smart. If you keep in mind that you’re dealing with the world’s smartest man, you could wind up agreeing to a lot of crazy stuff because it’s coming from “the world’s smartest man.”</p>



<p>It’s a simple example, but cults tend to happen because of an idea that someone is infallible, speaks or god, is really a genius, or has some other reason for authority. Once people believe that commitment, they can rationalize all sorts of things from that premise.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-terrible-ideas-from-commitments">Terrible Ideas from Commitments</h3>



<p>Commitments are used in scam methods often. It’s common to build up commitment over time and start with small things that you agree with. Once they get you to buy into the small commitment, it’s easier to build bigger, more unreasonable beliefs on top by convincing you that you’re staying committed to those initial good ideas.</p>



<p>It’s important to remember that people who’ve made commitments usually have internally consistent logic. From the outside, their beliefs and actions may look crazy or disconnected from reality. Or it may seem like they’re intentionally ignoring something that seems very obvious to you. But they’ve built everything around certain commitments. To them, everything seems coherent and logical because it supports those commitments. And it can be very difficult to step back and question those fundamental assumptions.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>It might look completely unhinged from reality. But … if they can get you to throw out all the other stuff and accept that one premise, you can be acting completely logically, completely reasonably, given that premise. </p>
<cite>Dan Simons</cite></blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-see-the-bigger-picture-and-spot-scam-methods">How to See the Bigger Picture and Spot Scam Methods</h2>



<p>For commitments specifically, part of the problem is that we’re not aware of the assumptions we’re making. If you were in NXIVM, you might not always be thinking about how your leader is the smartest man in the world. But you may have internalized it and act from that assumption without thinking about it.</p>



<p>It’s important to take the time to ask what you’re assuming about a situation. Even when not trying to spot scam methods, it’s a good thinking tool in general. Ask yourself if there was any information that would get you to change your mind, and if there’s anything you believe that would change anything if you were wrong. You may not be open to having your beliefs changed. But you might be.</p>



<p>One of scammers’ most important scam methods is to keep you from asking questions. They’ll do anything they can to keep you from talking to anyone else or getting any other perspectives. Some scammers will get aggressive or try to browbeat you if you ask questions. The best thing you can do iis ask someone else. When working on their book, Dan and Chris found many stories where someone saw the situation by accident and pointed out that it was a scam. Once the bubble was pricked and the would-be victim had an opportunity to reevaluate their beliefs, many of them realized it was a scam. Ask someone outside the situation what they think is going on. They might see the scam methods for what they are.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Having somebody else look at it who might have different motivations, different desires, might see through it and say, “Okay, wait. That’s too good to be true,” and force you to think about it for a second. </p>
<cite>Dan Simons</cite></blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-an-increase-in-scams-or-in-scam-awareness">An Increase in Scams or in Scam Awareness?</h2>



<p>We are definitely hearing more about scams. But is this increase because there has been an increase in scams or because there is more <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/scam-protection-awareness-isnt-enough">awareness</a> about them? It’s really hard to tell. We can look at statistics, but those won’t give us a solid answer, either – statistics could show an increase because people are more comfortable reporting it now.</p>



<p>As new technology and industries are created and aren’t regulated, it creates more spaces that are ripe for scams. There’s been so many things happening with <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/crypto-scam-recovery-fraud">cryptocurrency</a>, <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/what-you-need-to-know-about-ai-and-copyright-law">AI</a>, and other new technology, that it’s possible scams are on the rise just because there are so many more technologies to scam with. It could also be because there has been more reporting and documentation about it lately and more people are willing to come forward about being scammed.</p>



<p>Technology also makes it easier to use scam methods at scale. Even in the last twenty years we’ve seen the rise of large-scale industrial scamming. Even the classic <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/419-scam">Nigerian Prince</a> and advance fee scams are easier to pull off now because of email. But people aren’t changing as fast as technology is. Scam methods are still going to capitalize on the same tools to trick us. We’ll see the same methodologies, just in new contexts.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Every new advance is going to lead to new variants of these [scams] that are more sophisticated, but they all rely on the same principles. </p>
<cite>Dan Simons</cite></blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-future-of-scams">The Future of Scams</h2>



<p>Dan thinks AI and large language models are an interesting case because they make it easier to spread misinformation at scale. It could even take the scammer out of part of the scamming process to make it less costly for scammers. At the very least, it will make it easier to use scam methods at scale.</p>



<p>At the very least, Dan hopes that people will realize tools like <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/openai-chatgpt">ChatGPT</a> and other large language models speak with absolute certainty but have no connection with truth. They might generate reasonable answers most of the time, but unreasonable or false answers sound just as good and confident. As people start to realize these models aren’t representing truth, Dan hopes it causes people to start questioning all messages, even if they’re not driven by AI.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>It should take some work to have an opinion. You should have to gather some evidence to support why you believe something. </p>
<cite>Dan Simons</cite></blockquote>



<p>If we could be deceived easily by a large language model, we could just as easily be decieved by a person. It might make people more questioning and less accepting of content they receive.</p>



<p>That’s also Dan and Chris’s best advice for spotting and avoiding scam methods. You can’t just trust – trust, but verify. Be willing to be a bit uncertain. Don’t accept things at face value and don’t decide to believe without doing a little research, even if it sounds logical and reasonable. Do more checking and ask more questions.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Accept less, check more. </p>
<cite>Chris Chabris</cite></blockquote>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-discord-snapchat-and-instagram-each-have-a-dark-corner">Discord, Snapchat and Instagram each have a dark corner. </h3>



<p>If you’re a parent listen closely. No matter how good, responsible and trustworthy your kids are, or you think they are, trouble is nearby. You have NO way of knowing what they’re doing online, especially with their phones.</p>



<p>One of the biggest issues for parents is the peer pressure their kids are under to have a phone.</p>



<p>But it’s not only the kids’ fault—many parents want their children to have a phone to keep in touch, and that’s a two-way street. They want to know when their kids need something and check up on them as well.</p>



<p>And for kids, they now have a way to stay in touch with their friends, too and not feel left out. (They like that aspect of having a phone more than keeping in touch with their parents or guardians.)</p>



<p>That’s what smartphones are and were supposed to be for—in a perfect world. Keeping in touch. But we don’t live in a perfect world.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-social-media-is-where-kids-live-and-where-predators-lurk"><strong>Social media is where kids live, and where predators lurk.</strong></h3>



<p>In 2002 a survey was done by the Pew Research Center that showed some startling statistics.</p>



<ul class="has-background" style="background-color:#f0f9ff">
<li>Almost half of teenagers aged 13-17 reported they are online almost constantly throughout the day.</li>



<li>The platforms they’re using aren’t Twitter or Facebook, like their parents use. It’s YouTube, TikTok, Instagram and a slew of others where their age group interacts.</li>
</ul>



<p>There are also a long list of social media sites that their parents aren’t on, don’t use or even know anything about.</p>



<p>That’s where the danger lies.</p>



<p>And let’s not forget, there are hundreds of apps for playing games, sharing photos, making new friends and posting videos.</p>



<p>Here are three well-known social media platforms that are readily available to kids (and predators) to know about. They could easily land them into trouble, according to the website, <a href="https://security.org">security.org</a>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-snapchat-the-potential-problem-it-lets-kids-send-messages-that-disappear-after-a-day"><strong>Snapchat:</strong> The potential problem: It lets kids send messages that disappear after a day.</h3>



<p>There’s one thing that ALL parents have in common—they were once kids too. Remember that there were times that you probably didn’t let your parents know exactly what you were up to. Or maybe you even lied about where you were, what you were doing, or who you were with.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>It’s part of growing up for most kids and the rise of social media has taken that to incredible levels.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>So, a teenager could post a message with a candid photo to a new friend and 1) not know it’s actually a predator or scammer on the other end, and 2) think that because they deleted the photo, no one will see it.</p>



<p>Wrong. In the wrong hands, a child or teen could be blackmailed, exploited and bullied.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-discord-a-whole-lot-of-craziness-going-on"><strong>Discord. A whole lot of craziness going on.</strong></h3>



<p>What is <a href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a>? It’s a social media platform that allows people to communicate in real time on a range of topics—actually, virtually any topic. Supposedly it sprung up from the idea of Slack, the communication platform used by companies: In that case, the common interest was a business industry.</p>



<p>It could help kids develop good communication skills with other people and allow them to make and build offline relationships with people who share a mutual interest. But it can be more—a lot more—not so good.</p>



<p>In Discord lingo, communities are called <strong>servers</strong>, and many of them are outright not intended for younger eyes&#8230;and you likely wouldn’t like your kids to be able to join and hop right in. In a test, people from <a href="https://security.org">Security.org</a> joined discord, put their age at 15 and could easily join an adult-themed community. There were unsavory servers as well, including some on hacking, identity theft, drugs and more.</p>



<p>Is that what you’d want your 11-year-old to stumble into?</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-instagram-a-real-eye-opener"><strong>Instagram. A real eye opener.</strong></h3>



<p>Everyone seems to be on Instagram, right? There are cute cat and funny dog videos, influencers and videos on every topic. But there’s also a dark underside to the platform that a dark community is well aware of.</p>



<p>A Wall Street Journal article in 2023 revealed that there are corners in Instagram where some unsavory subscribers hang out, including pedophiles. These pedophiles are daring enough to share pictures and exchange tips and advice on their favorite topics. Even if your kids don’t come across these people, it doesn’t mean that these people might not lure your kids with flattering messages or approach them with stark and disturbing images.</p>



<p>But your child doesn’t have to visit Instagram’s shady alleys to find content you’d find objectionable. There is so much content (it’s the fourth-most popular app out there) and Instagram allows pornographic contents: Yes, supposedly there are age filters and such, but 1) they don’t always work, 2) strangers may still be able to view your kids’ posts, and 3) Instagram’s own monitoring and filtering seems to strangely not be working as advertised. In other words, it seems these platforms are sometimes quite okay skirting the lines of doing what’s right for children and parents.</p>



<p>And there’s this. Many safety measures that social media platforms put in place don’t prevent kids from seeing what they shouldn’t and don’t stop them getting to content they are driven to see.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kids-will-be-kids-predators-will-be-predators"><strong>Kids will be kids. Predators will be predators.</strong></h3>



<p>As a parent who was once a child and a teenager, do you remember when you were determined to do or see what you really wanted to see? These days, with social media and all their logarithms and now augmented intelligence, kids don’t stand a chance.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Not only are they led by their hormones, peer pressure, and young, still-developing minds, but they are also bombarded by suggestions and images fed to them by the platforms themselves.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>They don’t need to be exposed to all there is to see online. Once seen, it is hard to be unseen.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-wanted-parental-intervention-needed-parental-controls"><strong>Wanted: Parental intervention. Needed: Parental controls.</strong></h3>



<p>If you’ve made it to this end of the article you’ve gotten the message loud and clear. Parents and guardians have to step up and protect their kids.</p>



<p>No one else will do it and, in reality, parents should be the ones to step up. </p>



<p>You’re not alone. There is plenty of great information online on the topic, which has become more urgent and louder. There are also software programs and apps available that parents can use to protect their kids.</p>



<p>To learn more and see what the top programs are to help parents keep their children safe online and safe from predators, read our article on this important topic.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>If you think about it, the technology we have around us today is pretty incredible. From generative AI tools like <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/how-to-get-banned-from-chatgpt">ChatGPT</a> to <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/long-lost-relative-scams-other-issues-with-dna-testing">DNA testing</a>, so many technological abilities that are normal now would have been something out of a <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/classic-80s-movies-that-accurately-predicted-the-future">sci-fi film</a> or a <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/technology-from-james-bond-movies-that-exists-now">James Bond</a> movie thirty years ago. But just like in science fiction, new technologies come with new risks. If you have wifi-connected appliances or “smart” gadgets on the Internet of Things (IoT), these IoT devices are at risk from attackers. And on an even larger scale, new technology has opened more opportunities for cyber warfare.</p>



<script async="" data-type="track" data-hash="32XDRaOgO0" data-track="181" src="https://app.fusebox.fm/embed/player.js"></script><br>



<p><em>See </em><a href="https://www.easyprey.com/securing-iot-and-cyber-warfare-with-mikko-hypponen/"><em>Securing IoT and Cyber Warfare with Mikko Hypponen</em></a><em> for a complete transcript of the Easy Prey podcast episode.</em></p>



<p>Mikko Hypponen is an old-school <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/hacking-basics">hacker</a> from Helsinki, Finland. He started programming as a teenager, sold his first programs when he was seventeen, and reverse-engineered malware for the first time in 1991, when he was twenty-one. He has spent the past thirty-two years tracking online attackers, finding out where <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/organized-cybercrime-research">organized cybercrime</a> gangs come from, and tracking government cyberattacks, especially from <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/hacking-101-a-day-in-the-life-of-a-russian-hacker">Russia</a>. In addition, he has written for the <em>New York Times</em>, <em>Wired</em>, and <em>Scientific American</em>, lectured at the Universities of Oxford, Stanford, and Cambridge, and sits on an advisory board with Europol.</p>



<p>Mikko’s mother got into computers in the 1960s, when very few people were working with computers. During the defining years of his childhood, she brought home computer punch cards and stories of working with technology. When he was sixteen years old, she told him, “Mikko, you should study telecommunications. Telecommunications is the future.” This was before mobile phones were common, so the advice was prescient. If you had told Mikko back then that eventually everyone would have a computer in their pocket, he wouldn’t have believed you. But his mother was right.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-iot-devices-and-security">IoT Devices and Security</h2>



<p>IoT devices, also known as “smart” devices, are quite popular. And there’s a good reason for that. Though some smart devices seem <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/idiotic-smart-gadget">useless or unnecessary</a>, many others can benefit our lives. For example, Mikko doesn’t have a smart fridge himself. But he has seen people out grocery shopping who can’t remember if they need milk, so they pull out their phone to see what’s in the fridge. Those kinds of features make IoT devices helpful in everyday situations.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1136317353-1024x683.jpg" alt="IoT devices can be very useful in life." class="wp-image-6207" srcset="https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1136317353-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1136317353-300x200.jpg 300w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1136317353-768x512.jpg 768w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1136317353-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1136317353-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I understand perfectly well why people have smart doorbells or smart fridges. &#8230; The problem really is that nobody configures these correctly.</p>
<cite>Mikko Hypponen</cite></blockquote>



<p>But IoT devices also come with a lot of security risks. Part of that is because in the marketplace, the cheapest product wins. For vendors building an appliance, there’s no incentive to make it secure. If they invest the time and money to make their smart fridge more secure than their competitors, in the end they’ve just made the product more expensive.</p>



<p>Another problem is that nobody configures their IoT devices correctly. Nobody plans to update the firmware on their refrigerator. And when people go shopping for new appliances, they ask questions about the color, or the size, or the price. Nobody asks questions about security. That’s a large problem.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-regulation-for-iot-device-security">Regulation for IoT Device Security</h3>



<p>In many ways, the lack of security in IoT devices is a market failure. Even though security is important, the market doesn’t reward it. The way we typically try to fix market failures is through regulations. Mikko is generally not a fan of regulation. But if we’re going to regulate something, this would be a good place to do it.</p>



<p>If you buy a washing machine and it catches fire in the middle of the night and burns your house down, the vendor who built that washing machine is liable for damages. But if that same washing machine has weak security, a hacker can get access to your <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/network-security-for-dummies-guarding-your-home-network">home network</a>, and you wake up to every device in your house infected with <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/the-dangerous-evolution-of-ransomware">ransomware</a>, the vendor who left the security so weak isn’t liable for anything. Regulation could make the vendor liable. That would provide incentive for vendors to build IoT devices that are more secure.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to Secure Your IoT Devices</h2>



<p>IoT devices have risks. But that doesn’t mean you can’t use them if you want to be secure. There are steps you can take to manage your IoT devices to be more secure. Mikko’s first piece of advice to anyone with any kind of “smart” device: Read the manual!</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Many of these hackable devices wouldn&#8217;t be hackable if the consumers would simply read the manual.</p>
<cite>Mikko Hypponen</cite></blockquote>



<p>Lots of information comes with every product you buy. If you buy an IoT device, the manual probably has instructions to change the default password, configure the security, prevent outsiders from accessing the controls, or even how to segment your whole network so someone who accessed your smart gadget can’t access any of your computers. The problem is that nobody reads the manual.</p>



<p>Vendors should have some responsibility for IoT device security. But consumers have to take some responsibility, as well.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-malware-for-smart-devices-is-increasing">Malware for Smart Devices is Increasing</h3>



<p>When Mikko looked at internet traffic over the <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/ipv4-parts">IPv4</a> space, especially malicious traffic, he found some surprising changes. In the past, malicious traffic was mostly malware for Windows devices. But it isn’t anymore. Most malware traffic now is <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/10-reasons-why-you-should-switch-to-linux">Linux</a>-based.</p>



<p>The reason for this is IoT malware. There are plenty of IoT devices running on Linux. And much of this malware is very simple. Known as “Mirai” malware, it tries to infect devices by trying known weak username and password combinations.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why Hackers Want Access To Your IoT Devices</h2>



<p>You might be thinking, “I can understand why a hacker would want to get into my laptop or my wifi network. But what could they do with my washing machine or my refrigerator?” And the answer is, a lot! IoT devices can be used to “pivot” through your home network – if it’s not properly configured, a hacker could get into your <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/smart-light-bulbs-wave-of-the-future-or-security-threat">smart lightbulb</a> and use that to attack your laptop or phone. These attacks, though, are most commonly done against businesses, not home networks.</p>



<p>But even if a hacker isn’t using your IoT device to get into your other devices, there are other things they can do with it. A lot of people think there’s not much computing power available to steal from these devices. But there is more than you would think. Mikko regularly sees security cameras that have been taken over by <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/spam-botnet">botnets</a> that hackers use to send malware, spam, and scams to others. They can also be used to launch <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/types-of-cyber-attacks">“denial of service” attacks</a>, which can be very powerful if there’s several thousand IoT devices behind it. Russia used botnets for denial of service attacks against a recent NATO summit in Lithuania.</p>



<p>Another thing that hackers can use your IoT devices for is <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/what-is-cryptocurrency-a-primer">cryptocurrency</a> mining. There are cryptocurrencies designed so you don’t need a dedicated device to mine them. Hackers can put crypto mining software on your smart device and create money for themselves – while you pay for the electricity and the bandwidth it needs to run.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-you-can-do-before-and-after-you-re-compromised">What You Can Do Before (and After) You&#8217;re Compromised</h2>



<p>Even the smartest people can make mistakes. Anyone, even security experts, can be anxious, in a hurry, or not paying attention. That includes Mikko. Mikko works in security, but he’s had his <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/managing-credit-cards-with-sara-rathner">credit card</a> number stolen twice and has accidentally infected several computers with malware.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I completely understand why people get infected or why people get fooled. When you are tired, when you&#8217;re anxious, when you&#8217;re in a hurry, we all make mistakes. I make mistakes.</p>
<cite>Mikko Hypponen</cite></blockquote>



<p>Before your computer or IoT device is compromised, the number one rule is <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/backup">backups</a>. You have to have some kind of recovery method. What that is differs depending on whether you’re backing up a business device or a personal one. But especially for home users, a <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/the-safest-cloud-storage-apps-in-2021">cloud</a>-based backup is a great option. Apple, for example, puts most things in their <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/how-to-secure-your-icloud-account-from-spies">iCloud</a> by default, so backups are practically automatic. And even if the current version is corrupted, companies can roll back to a previous version and recover your data.</p>



<p>But what if the compromise has already happened? The hackers have taken over your IoT devices, or your laptop is riddled with ransomware. Mikko’s top tip for this applies to any crisis situation. Whether you think you’ve been hacked, you got scammed, or you got a phone call or an email about something important, you can apply this tip. It’s very simple: Take a break. Step out of the room or take a walk around the block if you can. Clear your head and reconsider what’s happening. Think it through before you take any action. What’s the real information? Are you being tricked? Did you make a mistake? Who should you call for help about this? Acting without thinking it through could make the situation even worse. Take time to think first.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-russia-and-cyber-war">Russia and Cyber War</h2>



<p>Finland shares about nine hundred miles of border with Russia, and both of Mikko’s grandfathers fought Russians in World War II. Because of this, Finnish cybersecurity companies pay attention to what’s happening in Russia – not just the cybercrime gangs, but also government actors. There have been plenty of attacks by the government over the last fifteen years, most of which were espionage. But now, things are becoming more concrete. They’re not just doing espionage with cyber tools, they’re also doing sabotage.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>These should be called cyber weapons and this should be called cyber war.</p>
<cite>Mikko Hypponen</cite></blockquote>



<p>War has expanded from its original domain. Thousands of years ago, we only had wars fought on land. Now, if you look at the war between Russia and Ukraine, they are fighting in five domains: Land, sea, air, space, and cyberspace. And the technology that allows these new domains allows spying and espionage, which is crucial. In World War II, the only way to find out about troop movements and gatherings was to send someone over there to look. The Russia-Ukraine war still uses tanks and people in ditches with assault rifles. But now tech allows both sides to send drones and satellites to track troops, triangulate radio signals, and track mobile phones. It’s a huge difference.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cyber-attacks-are-the-game-changer">Cyber Attacks are the Game-Changer</h3>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Technology is shaping war in many ways, but the real game changer is cyber attacks themselves.</p>
<cite>Mikko Hypponen</cite></blockquote>



<p>Russia has been targeting Ukraine with cyberattacks for the past seven years, both trying to gain access and information and to destroy things. When war broke out in February last year, there were days-long waits at the border because of a successful Russian cyberattack. They had wiped all the Ukrainian border control computers. The borders were open, but everything had to be done by pen and paper so it was much slower. That’s what normal modern cyber war looks like.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1406786132-1024x683.jpg" alt="Cyber warfare sounded like science fiction decades ago - now it's happening." class="wp-image-6208" srcset="https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1406786132-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1406786132-300x200.jpg 300w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1406786132-768x512.jpg 768w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1406786132-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1406786132-2048x1366.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Ukraine has become the best company in Europe at defending against Russian governmental cyberattacks. It’s because they have been targeted by these attacks for so long. When you do something over and over again, you become an expert in it. Mikko is in the military reserves in Finland, and when he goes in for refresher training they give him a keyboard because that’s what he’s best at. They rehearse and play war games, imagining what they would do in various scenarios. But Ukraine isn’t rehearsing. They’ve been fighting a cyber war against Russia for years, so they have the expertise.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-future-of-cyber-war">The Future of Cyber War</h3>



<p>War is shaped by technology. Whatever the next domain of war will be will also be shaped by technology. Thirty years ago, cyber war sounded like science fiction. Whatever the next domain of war is will sound like science fiction to us right now, too.</p>



<p>Mikko isn’t sure what it will be, but he can make a guess. It may be nano warfare. With advancements in nanotechnology, armies could disperse aerosols over battlefields that are full of nanobots. Those nanobots could get into enemy soldiers’ bloodstreams, travel to their brains, and change their thoughts.</p>



<p>Does that sound like science fiction? Absolutely. But thirty years ago the idea of cyber war also sounded like science fiction, and it’s happening now.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ai-in-cyber-war-malware-and-security">AI in Cyber War, Malware, and Security</h2>



<p>Mikko started working with machine learning systems for cybersecurity products in 2005. That was almost two decades ago. All that time, he has been waiting for enemies to catch up and start using the same AI and machine learning technology. Mostly, he’s still waiting. We have seen <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/deep-fakes-with-lonnie-waugh">deep fakes</a> and the first malware written in Python with the help of <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/openai-chatgpt">GPT</a> AI tools. But we have yet to see it used for the most dangerous potential option – fully automated malware.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>What really is still missing, which could happen any day, is complete automation of malware campaigns.</p>
<cite>Mikko Hypponen</cite></blockquote>



<p>Many security companies can use machine learning technology to attract attacks with bait, get a sample, run it in virtual systems, analyze it, and build detection systems in a matter of minutes. But right now, attackers are still working manually. They write new ransomware, craft <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/detect-phishing">malicious emails</a>, register <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/domain-name">domain names</a>, and send spam at human speeds, while we’re defending at machine speeds. When the attackers shift into full automation, it will be a whole new challenge. If they can compromise your IoT devices and put malware on your computers just as fast as we can defend them, we don’t really know who’s going to win. At that point, the best thing to defend you from bad AI is good AI.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Personal information about you is probably publicly available online, right now.

<p>Personal information about you is probably publicly available online, right now. Sites known as data brokers gather up info about you and build a profile with your name, address, phone number, and other details. Sometimes they even have photos of you.</p>



<p>Sounds like a major invasion of privacy, right? Technically, it’s legal for data brokers to do this. Fortunately, it’s also legal for you to request that your information be taken down. You can submit requests to each data broker one at a time or you can use a service to help you remove your information from the web all at once.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-5-best-services-for-removing-your-info-from-the-internet">The 5 Best Services for Removing Your Info from the Internet</h2>



<p>We rounded up the five best companies for online data removal. They all specialize in getting your info removed from people search sites. But some of them also help you delete profiles on marketing, recruitment, and financial sites, too.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-incogni">Incogni</h3>



<p><a href="https://incogni.com/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=home">Incogni</a> is a data removal service developed by the VPN company <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/vpn-reviews/surfshark-review">Surfshark</a> — so you know they take internet privacy seriously. When you sign up for Incogni, you provide your information and give over power of attorney, so the service can monitor for your personal information and contact data brokers on your behalf.</p>



<p>Incogni is one of the most comprehensive data removal services available, as it covers 180 data brokers in its database (more than most competitors). It also has a friendly user-interface and is easy to navigate. The company is pretty transparent about its practices as well. One of the main downsides to Incogni is that you don’t really have a way to confirm if the data has been removed after a request is sent.</p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Easy to set up</li>



<li>Sleek user interface</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Can’t easily confirm data removal</li>



<li>Only covers US, Canada, UK, Switzerland, and EU</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Price</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>$6.49 per month</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-deleteme">DeleteMe</h3>



<p><a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-558992-13790517?sid=5-tools-remove-data" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">DeleteMe</a> is an easy-to-use data deletion service that will help you get rid of information on data broker sites. It can help you delete existing information about you as well as submit requests for future takedowns (since data brokers can keep collecting data on you and start a new profile after you submit a request to delete).</p>



<p>One of the features of DeleteMe is that it’s a set-it-and-forget-it service. Once you sign up and provide your information, the DeleteMe service does all the work. You’ll also get periodic reports about what the service has found when monitoring for your information.</p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Quarterly reports</li>



<li>Easy-to-use interface</li>



<li>Free tutorials for DIY removal</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>You might have to provide ID documents for DeleteMe to remove info from data broker sites</li>



<li>Reports don’t link to brokers</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Price</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>$129 per year</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dataseal">DataSeal</h3>



<p><a href="https://dataseal.io/sites-we-cover?via=wimia-5-tools-remove-data" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">DataSeal</a> covers 136 sites that collect information, including data brokers, people searches, and public records. You can take a look at exactly <a href="https://dataseal.io/sites-we-cover?via=wimia-5-tools-remove-data">which sites their service includes</a> before you decide to purchase a monthly plan. DataSeal works similarly to the other data removal companies on this list, but it stands out for its stellar customer service.</p>



<p>With DataSeal, you can sign up for breach alerts and agency protection in addition to the standard data removal. Unlike other data removal services that you only hear from when there’s a problem, DataSeal sends you weekly privacy and safety reports.</p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>24/7 monitoring</li>



<li>Weekly reports</li>



<li>Coverage for unlimited addresses, phones, and emails</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>No free trial</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Price</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>$12.99 per month for the individual plan</li>



<li>$10.99 per month for the family plan</li>



<li>$8.99 per month for the business plan</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-privacybee">PrivacyBee</h3>



<p>One of the standout features of <a href="https://privacybee.com/">PrivacyBee</a> is the free risk assessment. You can do a scan using their service to see how much of your personal info is available, and decide whether you want to take action. You can also get breach monitoring with a free account.</p>



<p>If you want proactive data removal (i.e. they contact brokers and people search sites on your behalf), you’ll have to upgrade to a paid account. While PrivacyBee’s search and features are comprehensive, it only lets you enter one name, one email address, one phone number, etc. If you want it to scan for and remove multiple email addresses, for example, you’ll have to get a second account.</p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Free risk assessment</li>



<li>Helps you opt out of junk mail by industry</li>



<li>Browser extension to limit tracking</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>One of the most expensive data removal services on the market</li>



<li>Plans don’t include coverage for multiple phones, emails, and addresses</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Price</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>$197 per year</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kanary">Kanary</h3>



<p>Like PrivacyBee, <a href="https://www.kanary.com/">Kanary</a> offers a free version of their product with limited features. You can track two names, two addresses, one username, one email account, and one phone number with Kanary’s free tier. You also get three automated removals without having to pay a dime (competitors will monitor for free but won’t over the removal unless you pay).</p>



<p>Kanary’s scan covers Google search results plus 327 sites — many more than some of its competitors. The automated opt-out process only works for about 260 of those sites, however. You have to pay for the highest tier to get all those opt-out options as well.</p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Full transparency on how it handles each broker site</li>



<li>Data removal automation</li>



<li>Multi-factor authentication</li>



<li>Free trial</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Automated opt–out doesn’t apply to every site</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Price</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Free-forever plan with limited features</li>



<li>$12 per month for an individual</li>



<li>$20.75 per month for a family</li>
</ul>



<p></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What are data brokers and how do they get your info?</h2>



<p>Data brokers are websites that gather publicly available information about individuals to build a profile about them. They scrape public records, social media, online retailers, and web forums to find information. They also pay other data brokers.</p>



<p>Also known as people search sites or people lookup sites, data brokers may have any of the following information about you:</p>



<ul>
<li>Name</li>



<li>Date of birth</li>



<li>Address</li>



<li>Phone number</li>



<li>Email address</li>



<li>Place of work</li>



<li>Schools attended</li>
</ul>



<p>As you can imagine, having this type of personal information available online for anyone to see can be a security risk. Hackers and cybercriminals can use these people search sites to build a profile of you and make their attack more targeted. If your name and info appears on a data broker site, you should probably try to get rid of it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How much does it cost to remove your personal information from the internet?</h2>



<p>The cost of removing your information from the web can range from $10 per month to a flat fee of $2,500. The services mentioned on our list all charge based on a subscription model. You sign up and pay a monthly fee, and they offer continued monitoring and data removal requests on your behalf.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Remove your info and protect your privacy</h2>



<p>Technically, you don’t need any of these services to help you remove your information from the internet. You can do it yourself. But that is time-consuming and inefficient. Your info could be present on multiple data broker and people search sites, and you would have to submit a takedown request to each site, one by one.</p>



<p>Tools like Incogni or DataSeal can take care of this for you. Not to mention they have better monitoring than you likely do — without an app or software to help you out, the info you can find is limited to whatever shows up on a Google search.</p>



<p>Take charge of your privacy and security online. For a small fee, you can have an expert service help clean up your data. You need not necessarily pay for one of these services indefinitely. Once you have your information removed once, you can secure your online accounts to prevent your info from falling into data brokers’ hands again.</p>

<p>AI and U.S. copyright law are like your Facebook relationship status from 2011 — it’s complicated. For now, works created with generative AI cannot be copyrighted. Things created <em>partially</em> by AI can have a copyright, but only for the part the AI didn’t create. But as humans and machines continue working together the lines will get blurrier, making copyright law even messier.</p>



<p>There are also concerns over copyrighted material being used to train AI. It’s allowed for now, but it could also become more complicated as our use of AI continues to evolve.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="685" src="https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/a57-1024x685.jpg" alt="Internet law concept" class="wp-image-6195" srcset="https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/a57-1024x685.jpg 1024w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/a57-300x201.jpg 300w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/a57-768x514.jpg 768w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/a57.jpg 1196w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-generative-ai-works">How Generative AI Works</h2>



<p>Generative AI tools like Midjourney and <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/openai-chatgpt">ChatGPT</a> create images or texts based on prompts you give them. For a text-to-image tool, the prompt could be something like, “computer hacker in pixar movie style.” AI will spit out images for you to choose from. </p>



<p>For a generative text tool, you could ask for “a short essay about why cyber security is important” and it would write the essay for you. AI is able to create these images and texts using machine learning. It looks at millions of other images and texts — that were created by humans, mostly — and uses them to produce “original” works.</p>



<p>If the results you get from a generative AI tool are just culminations of other people’s work, does that make them original?</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="1024" src="https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/WIMIA-AI-Copyright-Article-Internal-Image-1024x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6196" srcset="https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/WIMIA-AI-Copyright-Article-Internal-Image-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/WIMIA-AI-Copyright-Article-Internal-Image-300x300.png 300w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/WIMIA-AI-Copyright-Article-Internal-Image-150x150.png 150w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/WIMIA-AI-Copyright-Article-Internal-Image-768x768.png 768w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/WIMIA-AI-Copyright-Article-Internal-Image.png 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The best result on Canva’s text-to-image AI generator for the prompt “computer hacker in pixar movie style.”</figcaption></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Is AI protected by copyright?</h2>



<p>In the U.S., works created with AI tools are not protected by copyright. The U.S. Copyright Office issued a decision in March, 2023 clarifying that works created using artificial intelligence are not eligible for copyright, even if they were created using prompts written by a human.</p>



<p>Does that mean that if you use AI <em>at all</em> in your creation that it can’t be copyrighted? Not exactly. You can still copyright your work, but only the portions of it that were created <em>without</em> AI.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Case of Zarya of the Dawn</h3>



<p>This stance from the U.S. Copyright Office came out of a <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/docs/zarya-of-the-dawn.pdf">case involving a comic book</a> that included illustrations created by generative AI tool Midjourney. The author of the graphic novel <em>Zarya of the Dawn, </em>Kristina Kashtanova, was originally granted a full copyright for the work in September 2022.</p>



<p>However, it was rescinded when the Copyright Office learned that Kashtanova used AI for the illustrations. She still has a copyright over the text in the novel, since she wrote that herself.</p>



<p>It boils down to this: if a human didn’t create something, it can’t be protected by copyright.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Who owns the copyright for works created by artificial intelligence?</h2>



<p>Nobody owns the copyright for works created by AI. The U.S. Copyright Office has made it clear that works created by AI fail the human authorship requirement. The same idea applies to animals who have managed to take photographs in the past — those photos can’t be copyrighted either.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Is it illegal to sell AI-generated art?</h3>



<p>You could reasonably say, therefore, that a work created with artificial intelligence is free to use as you wish. Does that mean you can sell images or texts made with AI? In most cases, yes. As long as the user agreement of the AI tool you’re using permits it, you can sell AI-generated art.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Are AI-generated images copyright free?</h2>



<p>Images created with AI do not carry a copyright — which is good news and bad news. It’s good if you’re looking for a sort-of customized image for a blog post, email, social media post, or similar project. It’s not good if you’re a creator whose work is used to train the AI, and the AI becomes capable of producing work strikingly similar to yours.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/a56-1024x683.jpg" alt="Magnifying glass focusing on the word copyright
" class="wp-image-6197" srcset="https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/a56-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/a56-300x200.jpg 300w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/a56-768x512.jpg 768w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/a56.jpg 1199w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Can AI use copyrighted works?</h2>



<p>Generative AI tools are able to produce “original”&nbsp; works by training on works actually created by humans. The AI can produce an image in the style of Andy Warhol because it studied the actual works of Andy Warhol. AI is allowed to train on copyrighted material as well, due to certain fair use laws.</p>



<p>If AI is using copyrighted material to create images, texts, or other works that very closely resemble the human-made original, is that stealing?</p>



<p>Legally, no. However, some artists and creators are arguing that it is. A <a href="https://newsroom.gettyimages.com/en/getty-images/getty-images-statement">lawsuit by Getty Images</a> against Stability AI states that their generative AI tool Stable Diffusion copied and processed millions of copyright-protected images from Getty — without getting permission or offering compensation.</p>



<p>Another class action lawsuit from three artists claims copyright infringement by Stability AI and Midjourney. The <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/pranavdixit/ai-art-generators-lawsuit-stable-diffusion-midjourney">artists claim</a> their work was unlawfully used to train the AI, and the AI can now create works that compete with their own.</p>



<p>For now, AI tools can still train on copyrighted materials. But that may change in the near future.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Deciding Who Has Rights in the Future of AI</h2>



<p>It didn’t take long for conversations about copyright and ownership to pop up after the explosion of generative AI tools. Whether or not you agree with the stance the U.S. Copyright Office has taken on the matter, you should know how ownership of creative works if you’re planning to use AI for your own creations.</p>



<p>If you are a creator, you should also keep a close eye on this space and watch how it develops. As the way we use AI continues to evolve, so will our rules and laws about copyright.</p>

<p>Whether you’re talking to a friend, interviewing a potential employee, making a sale, or recruiting a spy, human psychology doesn’t change. The foundations of an honest conversation are the same. We can use communication techniques to inspire trust and get the information we need. Master manipulators may know how to sound good without answering your questions, but they can’t outsmart your gut. Knowing what builds trust in a conversation can also help you spot when someone is untrustworthy.</p>



<script async="" data-type="track" data-hash="32XDRaOgO0" data-track="180" src="https://app.fusebox.fm/embed/player.js"></script><br>



<p><em>See </em><a href="https://www.easyprey.com/behavioral-analysis-from-an-fbi-expert-with-robin-dreeke/"><em>Behavioral Analysis from an FBI Expert with Robin Dreeke</em></a><em> for a complete transcript of the Easy Prey podcast episode.</em></p>



<p>Robin Dreeke is a former US Marine Corps officer and a retired FBI special agent. During his time at the FBI, he recruited spies, worked as a counterintelligence agent, and served as Chief of the Counterintelligence Behavioral Analysis Program. He strategized human interactions, recruited spies, and did double agent operations – exactly what you think of when you think of “spy stuff.” He also spent years as an instructor at the Counterintelligence Training Center. In addition, he is a keynote speaker and podcaster and has written three books about <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/how-to-read-body-language">behavior analysis</a> and communication techniques.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-scam-attempt-that-caught-robin">The Scam Attempt that Caught Robin</h2>



<p>Robin has been a victim of a lot of attempts at scams and fraud. But most of them didn’t go too far. Only one has made it far enough for him to react. It was around 2010. He was still with the FBI, at the time an instructor at a training center in Quantico, but also was becoming a public figure with a social media presence.</p>



<p>While driving one day, he got a message on <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/how-to-get-banned-from-facebook">Facebook</a> Messenger from his daughter, a teenager at the time. It said, “Dad, this strange picture of you popped up on Facebook, you might want to take a look.” Being a public persona and an FBI agent, Robin was understandably concerned. He immediately pulled over and clicked on the link. Typical Facebook pages can’t be seen if you’re not logged in, so Robin entered his login information on the screen.</p>



<p>Only once he was “logged in” did his logical thinking kick in. He realized he had most likely just given his Facebook username and password to a <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/fake-websites-imitating-real-websites">fake website</a> sending the information to scammers. Robin stayed pulled over on the side of the road while he changed every single password he had. In the end, nothing every came of it – likely because he realized his mistake and reacted so fast.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Why This Scam Worked</h3>



<p>This was an example of falling prey to your own confirmation biases. If you’re looking at things too emotionally or expect to see certain things, you won’t be able to see what’s really happening. You’ll only be able to see what you expect to see. When something or someone deviates from the normal pattern of behavior, you should <em>not</em> act. Look more closely at the situation before you react.</p>



<p>What Robin should have recognized in the message from his “daughter” was a deviation from his daughter’s behavior. She had never messaged him on Messenger before. That deviation should have made him stop and think. Instead, his curiosity and his concern that people would put compromising information about him online overrode his logical thinking. If he had stopped for a few moments to think, he would have realized the message was unusual for his daughter and become suspicious.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>If we can let go of our agenda … and we see what is rather than what we’re trying to see with our own confirmation biases, we take in a lot more data. </p>
<cite>Robin Dreeke</cite></blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Identifying Behavioral Patterns</h2>



<p>Every day, with everyone around us, we are establishing normal patterns of behavior. We are also establishing tempo, or the speed and rhythm that people tend to use. Robin’s neighbors raise honey bees, and one day Robin and his wife found a swarm in their bush. His wife was freaking out, but Robin wasn’t. It was because he was observing the tempo. The bees’ tempo was slower, not agitated, and the tempo didn’t change as Robin walked around. There was no danger. Obviously, he didn’t want to go up and slap them. Changing his tempo would impact their tempo. The same is true for humans – we can be influenced by the environment around us. But by knowing what the normal tempo is, we can spot when something is off.</p>



<p>The point is that you’re not <em>trying</em> to see anything. You can’t look for anything specific, or your confirmation bias will ensure you see it. Just watch what is there, and observe if something is out of tempo or out of place. You’ve probably heard the phrase, “If you see something, say something.” What that’s really saying is to look for deviations. If you spot a tempo, an object, or a behavior that seems out of place, that’s something that needs to be investigated.</p>

<p>The same thing is true when we have a feeling that a friend is upset or something is off. We’re picking up on an incongruence between their words and their behavior. The things they’re saying might sound right, but it doesn’t match the emotions they’re expressing nonverbally. For many of us, this is a gut feeling. We pick up on it but aren’t sure why. But learning to consciously spot behavior and tempo changes is a great communication technique. It can lead to better, more open conversations.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Demonstrating the Core Behaviors for Trust</h3>



<p>There are three core behaviors for trust: Openness, transparency, and vulnerability. If someone is not demonstrating these behaviors, you’re going to pick up on that. The trap many people fall into when we bring these communication techniques into conscious awareness is trying to label it. We identify an incongruence between words and behavior, or we sense that the person we’re talking to isn’t being fully open, transparent, or vulnerable with us.</p>



<p>Our instinct is to label it: The person is obviously lying or trying to deceive or manipulate us. But when we start placing those emotional labels on people, their defenses come up. You’re going to get into a conflict. It’s possible that their intention is self-centered and they are trying to take advantage of us or hide something. But it’s also possible the reason you feel something is off has nothing to do with you or any attempt to manipulate you.</p>



<p>When you start to notice changes in the normal pattern or feel like someone isn’t being fully open, transparent, or vulnerable with you, it’s time to engage another essential communication technique: Curiosity. Note that something is different and unusual, and start to wonder why. Then ask questions. If you’re talking to a friend, it could be as simple as saying, “Something seems a little off with you today. Is everything okay?” Or you could say something like, “I don’t fully understand, can you please explain more thoroughly?” If it’s a healthy relationship or conversation, the person should be able to give you an explanation. But if they start to “double-talk” – using a lot of words that sound good but don’t actually explain anything – that’s a sign that something unhealthy is happening.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">“Indicators” and Communication Techniques for Trust</h2>



<p>Another trap that many people fall into is looking for “indicators.” Indicators are specific words or phrases that people think point to something deeper or the “real truth” behind what someone is saying. But watching for indicators isn’t a communication technique. There are no magic words or key phrases that will secretly reveal what someone really thinks. And if you’re spending the entire conversation listening for key words or specific phrases, you’re going to miss what’s actually being said and the pattern changes that really tell you something is going on. Don’t listen for indicators, listen to understand.</p>



<p>If you don’t understand what someone’s saying, be curious. If you’re trying to create trust and determine if someone is trustworthy, curiosity is a fantastic communication technique. Focus on the other person and ask questions. “Why” questions are great because they force people to be very specific. If someone wants you to do something now and you ask why, they’ll give you reasons. These reasons may be why it’s beneficial to you. Or they could be a more simple answer – “I’m on a deadline and if I don’t meet my quota I won’t get my bonus this month,” for example. That’s openness and transparency there. They’re willing to tell you what’s going on behind the scenes. That’s an indicator that you can trust them.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Questions: An Essential Communication Technique</h3>



<p>If you’re still not sure about their trustworthiness, stay curious and ask more questions. Questions are going to be the biggest communication technique in your arsenal to determine if someone is trustworthy. Ask them about the company and its quota system, what kind of bonuses they’ll lose out on, how long they’ve been with the company, and if they like it there. When asking these “discovery questions,” watch the tempo and consistency of the responses. If they continue with a nice, even tempo, that’s another verification of trust. But if you detect they’re not telling you something, slow it down even further and ask more questions.</p>



<p>There’s an expression in aviation: “No emergency takeoffs.” Don’t be in a rush to get in the air – it will cause an emergency landing, or worse. Take your time and do your due diligence. The same is true when determining if you can trust someone. Ask questions and pay attention to their answers. “Why” questions are especially powerful as a communication technique. They require people to have a big-picture overview and explain the reasoning behind decisions.</p>



<p>Artful <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/negotiation-techniques">negotiators</a>, communicators, and manipulators are great at using words that make you feel like a million bucks. But they’re also great at doing that without really telling you anything. If you use “why” questions, it forces them to give you more information – or makes it much more obvious that they’re not telling you anything at all.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Real Vulnerability vs. Contrived Vulnerability</h2>



<p>Vulnerability is a key part of building trust. But manipulators can contrive vulnerability to trick you into trusting them. But you can use communication techniques to identify real vulnerability. To start, you have to know what vulnerability is. It’s the willingness to show your shame. Shame is a powerful emotion, and it dictates a lot of things in life.</p>



<p>One of the most common job interview questions asks about your weaknesses. When Robin interviewed people for the behavioral team, he always asked what they were working on in life. The goal is for the interviewee to be open and honest about what they’re not good at. If they were answering honestly, with congruent nonverbal communication and a consistent tempo, and willing to say what they weren’t good at, they were someone to trust.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>If you’re willing to be vulnerable and transparent on the things you’re deficient at, then I can most likely trust you. </p>
<cite>Robin Dreeke</cite></blockquote>



<p>Again, questions are going to be the communication technique you use here. If you are skeptical if someone is truly being vulnerable, ask more questions. Ask them about a time they fell short or failed, or about challenges in their career. And when they respond, look for congruence between their words and their behavior. The tempo of their responses should be consistent.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Establishing a Baseline</h3>



<p>What makes these questions useful as a communication technique to establish trust is knowing a person’s baseline. It’s hard to spot inconsistencies in behavior patterns and tempo if you don’t know what the normal pattern is for that person. And every person is unique. It’s important to start a conversation with a low-stakes topic – idle talk about the weather, where they’re from, or something similar. Pay attention to their behavior and tempo about these topics. Then you have something to compare to determine if they’re being genuinely vulnerable.</p>



<p>When establishing the baseline of that tempo, more data is better. The longer you’ve talked to someone and observed their behavior patterns and tempo, the better you will be at identifying changes and adapting to them. There’s no set amount of time you need to gather this baseline data. Everyone’s tempo and patterns are different. It depends on the individual.</p>



<p>If you are good at interacting and both of you are being open, transparent, and vulnerable, eventually your tempo will come into sync. Don’t force it – when it happens naturally, it feels great, but when it’s forced, the other person feels that something is wrong. The more you create trust, try to understand the other person, and stay in the present moment with them without trying to manipulate or extract information, your tempos will converge. That’s a great point where fantastic relationships can be built.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Using Communication Techniques to Identify an Unhealthy Conversation</h2>



<p>When we know what a good conversation looks like, we can reverse it. The reverse is what an unhealthy conversation looks like. Unhealthy conversations use communication techniques against us to try to force decisions or trick us into trust.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="696" src="https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1434334248-1024x696.jpg" alt="Understanding communication techniques can help you spot an unhealthy conversation." class="wp-image-6175" srcset="https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1434334248-1024x696.jpg 1024w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1434334248-300x204.jpg 300w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1434334248-768x522.jpg 768w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1434334248-1536x1044.jpg 1536w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1434334248-2048x1392.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>An unhealthy conversation will not be open or accommodating. Most people trying to manipulate you have an agenda and are on a timeline. They will try to push the tempo out of your comfort zone. If you are using good communication techniques, asking curious questions and trying to slow the tempo down, and they are not accommodating that change and trying to push it, that’s when it’s time to be done.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>That’s what you always want to watch. Watch for someone trying to push that tempo. </p>
<cite>Robin Dreeke</cite></blockquote>



<p>Someone who’s pushing the tempo has an agenda they’re not telling you. At best, that’s unhealthy. At worst, they’re trying to manipulate you. Rushing that tempo keeps you off-kilter. They also use it to get verbal commitments really quickly. Once we verbally commit to something, it’s hard to backtrack. We want to validate our own thoughts and opinions and don’t want information that contradicts what we’ve already obligated ourselves to. It’s emotionally difficult to back out of a commitment, so manipulators try to get a commitment from you as fast as possible.</p>



<p>Bad salespeople do this too. They often end up closing the sale, but they’ve ruined any chance of referral and left the buyer with buyer’s remorse. Even if the person pushing the tempo isn’t trying to defraud you, it’s a bad sign. Use good communication techniques and try to slow it down. If they keep trying to force your tempo, it’s time to leave the situation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Use Communication Techniques to Have Great Conversations</h2>



<p>These communication techniques are not tools to call out liars or accuse people of manipulation. Rather, they’re ways to facilitate good, open, transparent conversations. Focus on having great conversations with people. Observe changes in behavior and tempo, and don’t assign meaning to them – get curious and ask questions.</p>



<p>A great way to inspire people to not want to take advantage of you is to make it about them. When you make the conversation about them and listen to understand their thoughts and feelings, you become a real person to someone. If they can objectify you, it’s easy to take advantage. But if you become a real person to them, it’s much harder.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The easiest way to not be a victim is to inspire people to not want to victimize you. </p>
<cite>Robin Dreeke</cite></blockquote>



<p>Make it personal, and go down a road where it’s all about them. Seek their thoughts and opinions instead of sharing yours. Talk in terms of their priorities, challenges, and pain points. Validate them with non-judgmental curiosity about who they are. Empower them with choices. When you do these things, it becomes about them. Their brains reward them with serotonin, dopamine, and oxytocin. When someone’s oxytocin is flowing with you, the likelihood that they want to take advantage of you diminishes greatly. Robin isn’t saying it won’t happen – but it’s much less likely.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Since its unveiling in December 2023, ChatGPT has become the face of new, revolutionary technology. The cutting-edge AI has numerous benefits for personal and corporate users. However, bright red flags flame around the chatbot as its glitches still need to be ironed out.</p>



<p>The technology has gained rapid popularity, and over <a href="https://www.demandsage.com/chatgpt-statistics/">1 billion people</a> have used its services. While the powerful AI shows hope and promise, with great power comes great responsibility. It remains to be seen how <a href="https://openai.com/">OpenAI</a>, the creator of ChatGPT, will meet and conquer its challenges, which sparks some questions for users.</p>



<p>Questions private users may have include:</p>



<ul>
<li>How does ChatGPT work?</li>



<li>Is the sensitive and confidential data you plug into ChatGPT saved?</li>



<li>Will your private questions to ChatGPT end up public?&nbsp;</li>



<li>How do you protect your online security while using ChatGPT?</li>
</ul>



<p>Let’s take a look at the answers.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-does-chatgpt-work">How does ChatGPT work?</h2>



<p><a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/openai-chatgpt">Open AI’s ChatGPT</a> is a conversational, language-based AI that relies on Natural Language Processing (NLP) to communicate with users. Human feedback and input allow the AI to constantly learn and evolve, and allow it to give quasi-human-like responses to user questions.</p>



<p>Important facts about ChatGPT and how it works include:</p>



<ul>
<li>OpenAI unveiled its launch of AI on November 30, 2022.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>The ChatGPT input and training come from over <a href="https://www.demandsage.com/chatgpt-statistics/">300 billion words </a>and 570 gigabytes of text data.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>ChatGPT can remember past “conversations,” explain its answers with detail when asked, and will apologize when called out for incorrect answers.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>With input, ChatGPT can create written content — including fiction and personalized letters. A user must still edit and revise the content, but the basic story and outline can be generated.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>The chatbot also acts as a language translator, easily translating text from one language to another.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>ChatGPT can provide vital customer service tools for 24/7 support.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>Rather than acting as a search engine to gather data, the chatbot relies on the human input it has received to give answers.</li>
</ul>



<p>As ChatGPT receives more human input, its database grows. The version of ChatGPT available now will likely look vastly different from the ChatGPT models of the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-where-does-chatgpt-get-its-data">Where does ChatGPT get its data?</h3>



<p>The GPT in ChatGPT stands for Generative Pre-trained Transformer, which is the aspect of the program’s architecture that allows for conversational text creation, question answering, and translation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The AI’s responses to users are meant to represent human responses, rather than robotic, obviously computer-generated answers. ChatGPT gets its data from its human engineers who input countless books, journals, articles, and blog posts into its database. These texts are curated to ensure diversity in the chatbot’s archives.</p>



<p>ChatGPT operates differently than a search engine like Google, as its curated knowledge has been carefully selected, and it’s <a href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6783457-what-is-chatgpt">not connected to the Internet</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-does-chatgpt-save-your-sensitive-data">Does ChatGPT save your sensitive data?</h3>



<p>The good news is, OpenAI has a <a href="https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy">privacy policy</a> in place that keeps any user data information safe and secure. The sensitive and confidential data it collects from you includes social media accounts, payment information, and content you’ve uploaded. The privacy policy is parallel to that of many online-based businesses.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, OpenAI uses <a href="https://allaboutcookies.org/">cookies </a>and information about the device you’re using to connect to ChatGPT services. The company also stores your chatbot conversation data — which may or may not include sensitive or identifying information. There’s nothing nefarious behind this storage, and it’s used to improve ChatGPT’s abilities.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="633" src="https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/a59-1024x633.jpg" alt="Artificial intelligence machine learning concepts" class="wp-image-6178" srcset="https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/a59-1024x633.jpg 1024w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/a59-300x185.jpg 300w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/a59-768x475.jpg 768w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/a59.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Will your private questions to ChatGPT end up public?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>If you ask ChatGPT a question that contains sensitive, confidential, or identifying information, you don’t have to worry about public exposure. OpenAI utilizes data encryption to keep your private questions away from prying eyes. ChatGPT now includes a <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/chatgp-private-mode-how-to-use/">private mode</a>, which will prevent others from accessing your chat history.</p>



<p>However, if you remain in public mode, questions from “Why did I get dumped?” to “Is there a meaning to my street name (Snuffaluffagus Way)?”&nbsp; can be accessed by other users in your area. And specific questions may reveal your identifying information. Your question will remain in the ChatGPT database, and you’ll have no way to erase it from the public domain.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Is ChatGPT a threat to your privacy?&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Although OpenAI takes the security of its users seriously, there are still issues that may arise. For example, privacy concerns prompted <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/italy-ban-chatgpt-privacy-gdpr/">Italy to outright ban ChatGPT</a>. On March 31, 2023, the Italian data-protection authority announced the ban and investigation of ChatGPT.</p>



<p>The watchdog regulator cited OpenAI’s sourcing of information from blog posts and social media accounts as troublesome. ChatGPT doesn’t differentiate between personal and public data when “learning” and doesn’t ask for permission before using these sources. The concern and caution over the chatbot’s loose regulations and rapid growth are valid.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even in the U.S., technology journalists have sounded the privacy breach alarm. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/02/chatgpt-is-a-data-privacy-nightmare-and-you-ought-to-be-concerned/"><em>Ars Technica</em></a><em> </em>calls ChatGPT “a data privacy nightmare” as the bot contains 300 billion words from various, unsuspecting sources. Thus, although privacy and security parameters are in place for the chatbot users, unsuspecting data sources (which could be any of us) never gave permission for their words to be used.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="684" src="https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/a60-1024x684.jpg" alt="Database management, record keeping" class="wp-image-6179" srcset="https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/a60-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/a60-300x200.jpg 300w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/a60-768x513.jpg 768w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/a60.jpg 1198w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to protect yourself when using ChatGPT</h2>



<p>Users of ChatGPT have more control over their data protection than those who have been sourced by the AI. Currently, no one has control over giving or denying access to ChatGPT’s database.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, the terrible, break-up poetry blog you published for your 9th grade crush and then tried to push to the recess of your memory? If it still exists online, it may have found its way into the knowledge base of ChatGPT.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, when you use the chatbot, there are ways to protect your sensitive information when giving private questions to ChatGPT and steer clear of hackers. Here are a few things to watch out for, and ways to protect yourself:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Malware and viruses:</strong> Scammers could pose as known entities on a chat, and use ChatGPT to prompt you to download malware or other computer viruses.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Phishing scams:</strong> Online criminals may use ChatGPT to create <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/fake-websites-imitating-real-websites">phony websites</a> that look almost identical to original, legit websites. Make sure you check the URL and IP address before clicking on any links.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Utilize the privacy mode:</strong> When you’re using ChatGPT, take advantage of the privacy mode feature. This way, random strangers won’t have access to your chat and question histories.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Confirm identities:</strong> If someone is using ChatGPT to connect with you online and pose as someone else, their language may seem a bit off or clunky. The chatbot is still working on conversational glitches.&nbsp;However, this may be a way for a scammer to hide behind their purported identity with legitimate facts about the person they’re impersonating. Online criminals may use ChatGPT to try to access your money or confidential information by posing as a credible person or organization.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Implement ChatGPT policies and procedures for your business:</strong> Businesses should limit employee’s access to on-the-clock ChatGPT use and restrict its use to tasks which benefit the organization. The chatbot has numerous benefits for businesses including the undertaking of customer support and research work.&nbsp;Nonetheless, confidential and sensitive business data should be prohibited from sharing in ChatGPT. Implementing policies can prevent security breaches while still enjoying the upside of AI.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>On November 30, 2022, <a href="https://openai.com/">OpenAI </a>unveiled ChatGPT to huge buzz and great fanfare. Although many tech professionals predicted this new interface, its potential has exploded and seems limitless. ChatGPT, a <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/GPT-4">GPT-4</a> (Generated Pre-trained Transformer 4) AI conversational language processor, may prove to transform the face of technology and many other professional sectors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thus, staying in the good graces of the OpenAI Terms of Use is important. We’ll look at the history and future of this new highly-capable chatbot, and how you can get banned from using ChatGPT.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-history-of-openai-and-the-invention-of-chatgpt">The history of OpenAI and the invention of ChatGPT</h2>



<p>OpenAI began in 2015 as a startup technological research company with a focus on developing cutting-edge yet friendly AI. Thankfully, OpenAI doesn’t have a supervillain mission statement to destroy mankind.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rather, the company, which included <a href="https://blog.samaltman.com/">Sam Altman</a> (co-founder and current CEO of OpenAI) and Elon Musk among the collaborators in its earliest ventures, understands how AI can help better society.</p>



<p>OpenAI’s goal is to develop interactive GPT tech to empower people and help diminish the time we spend on miniscule tasks. By creating autonomous AI, the company hopes to enable people in every professional sector to focus on the big picture, and allow GPT to take care of time-consuming, smaller endeavors.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">ChatGPT</h3>



<p>In 2018, OpenAI unveiled the concept of the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT). The company’s new technology mimics the structural functions of the human brain. Its input and training comes from human engineers. However the newest version of GPT, ChatGPT-4, can also teach itself based on the input it has already received.</p>



<p>For example, on March 26, 2023, U.S. Senator Chris Murphy (D-CT) <a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisMurphyCT/status/1640186536825061376">claimed on Twitter</a> that ChatGPT wasn’t programmed for advanced chemistry, but learned it nonetheless.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ChatGPT differs from the versions before it, which were already significantly mind-blowing. For instance, <a href="https://openai.com/product/dall-e-2">DALL-E</a> (the GPT built after GPT-2), could create photo-like images which are hard to differentiate from authentic photos. ChatGPT understands context — it can tailor its answers to your questions based on your conversation and search histories.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ChatGPT application and its technology continue to evolve at a rapid rate.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to get banned from ChatGPT</h2>



<p>Although ChatGPT is still in its infancy, OpenAI has put some protective parameters in place. A lack of adherence to policies and procedures could get you banned from ChatGPT.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some of the ways you could get banned from ChatGPT include creating or sharing:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Adult content: </strong>Don’t use ChatGPT to create or locate adult content, and you’re in the clear.</li>



<li><strong>Fraud or fraudulent content:</strong> This can get a bit murky, as glitches surrounding the spread of disinformation exist in ChatGPT. However, if you’re blatantly using ChatGPT to commit fraud or share sourced content from fraudulent websites, you may get banned.</li>



<li><strong>Illegal activity: </strong>This is kind of a no-brainer. Don’t use ChatGPT to commit crimes. Period. You will be banned from the tool and could face criminal charges.</li>



<li><strong>Violent content:</strong> If you share content depicting violent acts such as murder or rape, you’ll get banned. This rule goes for any credible, safe online space.</li>



<li><strong>Violation of the OpenAI Terms of Use: </strong>We’ll expand on this below, but to avoid getting banned, read over the <a href="https://openai.com/policies/terms-of-use">OpenAI Terms of Use</a> before you use ChatGPT.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">OpenAI’s Terms of Use</h2>



<p>As ChatGPT-4 is a relatively new tool, OpenAI’s Terms of Use gives you a lot of freedom to experiment. The company wants the benefits of using this AI technology to outweigh the detriments, Thus, the policies and procedures surrounding it caution heavily against fraudulent content or bot accounts that completely rely on the tool.</p>



<p>The legal jargon used can make the document a bit tough to get through, so we thought we’d share the basics with you. Along with the aforementioned reasons for banning an account, the OpenAI Terms of Use for ChatGPT include:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Indemnification against legal liability: </strong>If content you’ve created with ChatGPT opens you to lawsuits, you’re responsible for all legal fees associated with the case and cannot place the blame at the feet of OpenAI. Remember you own the IP (Intellectual Property) you created with ChatGPT.</li>



<li><strong>Violation of human rights: </strong>If your use of ChatGPT infringes on the basic rights of another human being, or of an entire section of people, you’ll be found to be in violation of the Terms of Use.</li>



<li><strong>Claiming generalized responses as IP: </strong>If you use a popular ChatGPT response to a universal question, it is not your intellectual property: Claiming it as such is a direct violation of the Terms of Use.</li>
</ul>



<p>This isn’t a comprehensive list of tasks prohibited by the Terms of Use, and again, we suggest you read over the policies before you take a deep dive into ChatGPT.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="640" src="https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/a54-1024x640.jpg" alt="Human and Artificial Intelligence" class="wp-image-6168" srcset="https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/a54-1024x640.jpg 1024w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/a54-300x188.jpg 300w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/a54-768x480.jpg 768w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/a54.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How ChatGPT can change the future&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The most exciting aspect of ChatGPT is how many positive, transformative doors it can open for the future of how businesses operate. If parameters are set on how the technology is controlled and used ethically, the sky’s the limit for the positive impacts it will have on the world at-large.</p>



<p>Although the technology was first unveiled in December 2022, it had already gained <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/chatgpt-chatbot-tiktok-ai-artificial-intelligence/">100 million users</a> by January 2023. In comparison, Google Translate could only boast these significant user numbers after 6.5 years in existence.</p>



<p>Some of the benefits of ChatGPT include:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Appointments:</strong> ChatGPT can schedule appointments and interviews, and follow-up with customers and talent candidates.</li>



<li><strong>Customer service: </strong>ChatGPT can take away the need for 24-7 employees and, as it tailors responses based on an individual&#8217;s needs, can effectively answer consumer questions.</li>



<li><strong>Data entry:</strong> By plugging in data parameters and giving ChatGPT access to customer databases, the technology can take care of your data entry needs.</li>



<li><strong>Ideating headline ideas and website content: </strong>Although ChatGPT can generate an entire written article, the finished content often reads sterile and as if it was written by AI. However, the tool can produce a solid starting point based on the input of related information.</li>



<li><strong>The streamlining of overall operations: </strong>Businesses can delegate tasks to ChatGPT such as research and, ironically, human resources. For example, it may take you two hours to look up pertinent information for a new project. ChatGPT will be able to find that data for you in minutes.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>Another important and beneficial note about the tool is that <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-use-chatgpt/">ChatGPT remains free</a> to use.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">ChatGPT disadvantages and limitations</h2>



<p>The possibility of being banned from ChatGPT is just one of the disadvantages and limitations of using this AI tool.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You’ve probably heard some of the alarm bells being raised around <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/openai-chatgpt">ChatGPT and its risks</a>. The GPT technology is growing quickly. Although human engineers still maintain control of its evolution, this may not always remain the case. In fact, the technology behind the AI chatbot has generated a heated debate on its rapid acceleration.  </p>



<p>Scientists and tech giants, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, and even Elon Musk have signed an <a href="https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/">open letter </a>&nbsp;calling to slow down the technology. Although ChatGPT may have detractions, it also possesses numerous benefits. As it evolves, it may become an integral part of internet use and the global marketplace.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some of the disadvantages and fears associated with ChatGPT include:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Incorrect responses: </strong>Although ChatGPT is built to grasp context, it’s not yet (thankfully) a sentient AI, and may misunderstand nuance. So while generated responses to questions may technically be accurate, you should still fact check before using these responses for your own content.</li>



<li><strong>Inability to multitask: </strong>Thus far, ChatGPT can only successfully complete one task at a time. If you try to assign to multiple tasks, you may find it cannot execute any with accuracy.</li>



<li><strong>Robotic content: </strong>If you rely on ChatGPT to actually write your content for you, you may find some of the language used clunky or incorrect. At this point, content still requires a human finesse.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>People end up in a multi-level marketing company, or MLM, for different reasons. Maybe you wanted to help a friend. Maybe you wanted to make some extra money. Or maybe you were tricked and didn’t intend to sign up at all. It’s important to know that not all multi-level marketing companies are bad. But MLM scams do exist, and even ones that aren’t outright scams can include a lot of emotional manipulation or an unhealthy cult-like mentality. It’s important to be aware of the red flags to keep yourself safe.</p>



<script async="" data-type="track" data-hash="32XDRaOgO0" data-track="179" src="https://app.fusebox.fm/embed/player.js"></script><br>



<p><em>See </em><a href="https://www.easyprey.com/7-flags-of-mlm-with-roberta-blevins/"><em>7 Flags of MLMs with Roberta Blevins</em></a><em> for a complete transcript of the Easy Prey podcast episode.</em></p>



<p>Roberta Blevins is a former distributor for the MLM company LuLaRoe and a current anti-MLM educator and advocate. She starred in the Amazon Prime documentary <em>LuLaRich</em> and hosts a podcast, “Life After MLM,” where she talks to victims of cults, frauds, and scams about their experiences. Her goal isn’t to tell you not to join a multi-level marketing company. She focuses on red flag education so that you can identify when an environment is toxic and get out before you get hurt.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-roberta-s-experience-with-mlms-and-mlm-scams">Roberta’s Experience with MLMs and MLM Scams</h2>



<p>Roberta first joined the MLM company It Works. But for Roberta, it didn’t work. She didn’t like it and left it soon after. Then in 2015, she heard about LuLaRoe. She liked that it wasn’t like most MLMs, where everyone sold the same product. LuLaRoe distributors sold similar products in unique patterns. Roberta was also a young wife and new mom – she wanted to be at home with her child. The work-from-home aspect was very appealing.</p>



<p>Roberta joined LuLaRone in early 2016, and was in it for about eighteen months. She grew very quickly within the company. Eventually, she had a team of seventy-five women underneath her. Now, she estimates she was in the top five percent of the company. And the money she was making was decent. Unfortunately, it wasn’t any more than she had made at the job she quit to sell LuLaRoe full-time – but she was spending a lot more time working for the same money.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I wasn’t really making anything more than I was already making before, but I was working a lot more. </p>
<cite>Roberta Blevins</cite></blockquote>



<p>Looking back, there were definitely some red flags even in the beginning. But Roberta didn’t see them at first because there was so much dopamine manipulation going on. The company and other distributors hyped everything up. She had constant opportunities to go to events, parties, and conferences. She was busy and excited about the opportunity, so it took something big to make her realize the problems.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Bad Business Decisions</h3>



<p>Before joining LuLaRoe, Roberta was a hairstylist. She had run her own booth and a salon for a long time, so she understood basic business principles. And with that knowledge, she started to have a lot of issues with the way LuLaRoe was running its business. When she reported defective products and tried to initiate returns, she got the runaround. Several times she reported complaints with easy fixes. The company would promise the fixes but the never actually fix it. It was a terrible way to run a legitimate business.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I kept thinking, ‘A real business would fix it. A real business would think this was an issue.’ </p>
<cite>Roberta Blevins</cite></blockquote>



<p>Roberta wasn’t thinking about MLM scams. She didn’t know it was a pyramid scheme or about all its cult-like elements. She knew it was a business. And if it was a business, it was being terribly run. It was also harming her mental health. She was working much more to make the same amount of money she was previously. It wasn’t making her family happier, and she had become a completely different person. She decided she had to get out.</p>



<p>After leaving LuLaRoe, she started doing some research. That’s when she learned about MLM scams, how they can manipulate people, and how some of them become almost like cults. At the time, there were very few people willing to go on record and use their real names to talk about their MLM experiences. So Roberta started speaking out publicly about what had happened to her. That led to a Vice documentary, testifying in a pyramid scheme case against LuLaRoe (which settled out of court), the <em>LuLaRich</em> documentary, and her podcast.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Warning Signs of Abusive, Exploitative, and Manipulative MLMs</h2>



<p>If you’re thinking about <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/multilevel-marketing">joining an MLM</a>, it’s important to watch out for MLM scams. But it’s equally important to watch out for MLMs that aren’t outright scams, but are abusive, manipulative, exploitative, or otherwise harmful. Luckily, MLM scams and exploitative MLMs have very similar warning signs.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Pressure</h3>



<p>A big red flag for a manipulative MLM or an MLM scam – or any type of scam – is pressure. Scammers and people who want to exploit you will pressure you into making a decision. They may push you to make a decision right away, before you’ve had time to think. They may also try to manipulate you with desire for what you could get if you join or fear of what you could miss out on if you don’t.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1473907527-1024x683.jpg" alt="To avoid MLM scams, just say no if there's pressure to make decisions." class="wp-image-6146" srcset="https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1473907527-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1473907527-300x200.jpg 300w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1473907527-768x512.jpg 768w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1473907527-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1473907527-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Whether it’s an MLM scam, a manipulative and exploitative company, or just a salesperson who cares more about you buying than if the product will actually be beneficial to you, if you feel pressured, that’s a bad sign. Making a decision under pressure rarely results in a good decision.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Avoiding Questions</h3>



<p>It’s always a good idea to ask questions when presented with a <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/business-opportunity-scams">business opportunity</a>. But if you get pushback for asking questions, that’s a red flag. You may be told that asking those kinds of questions is being negative or not looking on the bright side. But only looking at the positives and ignoring the negatives is a great way to make terrible business and financial decisions.</p>



<p>If you express genuine concerns and they are brushed off, that’s a huge warning sign. This is true even if you’re already involved in the company. And if they won’t answer your questions, give dodgy or vague answers, or in any way indicate that you shouldn’t be asking questions, don’t get involved. If they won’t give you answers, don’t give them money – it’s that simple!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Secrecy</h3>



<p>Secrets can be a lot of fun. But secrecy around any business opportunity is always a bad sign. People involved in MLM scams or exploitative or manipulative MLMs sometimes post about “great opportunities” on social media. But if you comment to ask about the company, they will DM you or invite you to meet in person. If someone says that they have a great opportunity but aren’t willing to publicly state the name of the company, that’s a red flag. It usually means they don’t want you to google the company or do any of your own research before they can put you in a high-pressure sales presentation.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>If it’s a legitimate company, you should be able to say, ‘It’s this,’ and then that should be able to sand up to some scrutiny. </p>
<cite>Roberta Blevins</cite></blockquote>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Other Locations and Other People</h3>



<p>In the anti-MLM community, people involved in MLMs are called “Huns” – an affectionate term that comes from the common pitch greeting, “Hey, hon!” One of Roberta’s maxims is to never follow a hun to a secondary location, and she’s only partially joking. It’s a way to protect yourself from manipulation. When they meet with you, many people involved in MLM scams or manipulative MLMs will try to get you somewhere else.</p>



<p>They may also bring in other people to try to put more pressure on you or help with manipulation. Sometimes they’ll phrase it as having you talk to their mentor, or their upline, or something else. But if they can get you to another location where you’re alone and they can get another person to help put the pressure on you, it’s a bad situation for you. If the person proposing the business opportunity wants you to go somewhere else with them or bring in another person, that’s a warning sign. Don’t do it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">MLMs, MLM Scams, and Pyramid Schemes</h2>



<p>MLMs are technically not pyramid schemes. But there are many similarities between the two. In fact, the four cornerstones of MLMs can also be found in pyramid schemes. For some, this may not be a bad thing. As long as you’re avoiding MLM scams and manipulative and exploitative MLMs, it is possible to be really successful. But it’s also important to know what you’re getting into.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">A Pay-to-Play Model</h3>



<p>In this metaphor, the MLM is the game. In order to play the MLM game (get involved in the company and start making money), you have to pay. Some MLMs are free to join, and people think that this makes the entire point invalid. But even if there’s no membership fee to join, the first thing you have to do is pay to buy a starter kit. Sometimes that kit will be offered at a steep discount. But you have to get the kit, they say, because how are you supposed to sell the products if you don’t know anything about the products? Even if it was free to join, you still have to pay for the kit before you can start.</p>



<p>Conferences and events are also part of the pay-to-play aspect. You have to pay for the tickets, the hotel, the food, and the transportation. Even though the money isn’t necessarily going to the company itself, you still have to pay to get involved. That also feeds into the sunk cost fallacy – you stay longer than you would have otherwise because you’ve invested so much money into it already.</p>



<p>Having a pay-to-play model doesn’t necessarily mean it’s an MLM scam. But it doesn’t mean that it’s completely legitimate, either. Regardless of the company, the pay-to-play aspect is always involved, and that’s something to keep in mind.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Endless Chain</h3>



<p>Another cornerstone of MLMs is the endless chain. The endless chain is common to MLMs, MLM scams, and pyramid schemes. With a pyramid scheme, the endless chain requires recruitment that never ends. With MLMs, there’s a quota that you have to hit each month to get paid. That quota resets every month, and if you don’t hit it, you lose out on some or all of your earnings for the month. It’s an endless chain because you always have to qualify to get your money and it always resets.</p>



<p>What makes it especially difficult in MLMs is that people are constantly leaving. As bricks come out of your pyramid, you have to replace them with more bricks. And you have to hope it’s not load-bearing bricks that leave, because those are harder to replace.</p>



<p>With the endless chain, there’s no moment of leaving your job at the door. You are always on, always going, always trying to make another sale or another recruit. There’s never a time you can slow down or stop because that puts everything you’ve earned at risk. It’s a never-ending treadmill.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>You’re constantly on, You’re always trying to get somebody. You never want to leave any money on the table. That’s the endlessness of it. </p>
<cite>Roberta Blevins</cite></blockquote>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Recruitment Mandates</h3>



<p>In MLMs, MLM scams, and pyramid schemes, there’s always going to be a recruitment aspect. That’s because the system requires recruitment in order to make money. In a pyramid scheme, that’s the only aspect that makes money, because only money is being exchanged. But in an MLM, money is exchanged for products. (That’s the only difference between an MLM and a pyramid scheme – MLMs have products involved, and pyramid schemes don’t.) The payment structure works so that you get a cut of all the sales made by people you recruit. That makes it so the easiest and fastest way to make money is by recruitment.</p>



<p>There are exceptions to the recruitment mandates. Some people are just incredible salespeople. Roberta knew some people like that in LuLaRoe. They had small teams but incredible sales volume because they were good at it. Those kinds of people exist, but they are the exception. When a recruitment mandate is a foundational principle, without recruiting you will essentially stay at the bottom. Those who haven’t recruited anyone to work beneath them don’t get those bonuses from their recruits’ sales, which is where the big money is.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Extreme Money Transfer</h3>



<p>The fourth cornerstone of both pyramid schemes and MLMs is extreme money transfer. Extreme money transfer means that the majority of the money in the company is going to only the one percent of people at the very top. With the way bonuses are structured, most of the bonuses are routed to the top. The majority of people are making little or nothing.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Be Informed and Make Your Own Decisions</h3>



<p>Roberta would never join an MLM again. But she doesn’t like to tell people not to do it or to quit if you’re already involved. Her goal is to give you information. To her, those four cornerstones (and the fact that they’re also the cornerstones of pyramid schemes) seem like red flags. But you should do your own research and come to your own conclusions.</p>



<p>If you look at the numbers and decide the money works, then go for it. If the money doesn’t work or if it’s negatively impacting your mental health, energy, or the time you want to spend with your family, it might be a good idea to step away. Roberta just wants to make sure you know what the red flags are and to pay attention when you see them. It may help you avoid an MLM scam, a manipulative company, or financial loss or burnout down the road.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">When MLMs Go Under</h2>



<p>When you’re always “on,” the business opportunity quickly becomes more of a lifestyle than a job. It can invade every area of your life. Roberta has talked to many people whose MLM role became part of everything. Very few people she talked to had a great experience, didn’t spend too much time on it, and thought it was worth it.</p>



<p>Most people, even those who were successful, realized how much time and effort they were spending keeping up the facade of success. But an MLM can collapse – and not just MLM scams, legitimate MLMs can go under as well. And if that happens, you could lose everything.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Even though people think that this is their business, they really are just a 1099 contracted salesperson who works for commission. </p>
<cite>Roberta Blevins</cite></blockquote>



<p>Since everything is commission-based and dependent on the particular MLM’s products, you get no hourly pay for your work and no benefits. There’s no retirement plan or 401(k). If the entire organization goes under, that bonus check you count on every month stops coming. And you get no unemployment, either. It can be devastating if you’re not paying attention or prepared.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Appearance of Success</h2>



<p>Many people who get involved in MLMs use up a lot of their savings on it. They get into the lifestyle, and there’s a pressure to fake it until you make it. You want the appearance of success because when you approach people (or they approach you) about the opportunity, they’re more likely to join if you look the part. Some MLM conventions have vendors outside that rent designer clothes, shoes, and purses. The people on the stage can go rent them right outside to appear more successful on stage.</p>

<p>There’s a promise of the American Dream that everyone wants. The people above you say you just have to do these things and you’ll be as successful as them. Because all these successful people are telling you what to do, you feel like you should do it. Even if it’s not an outright scam, it comes back to the MLM pay-to-play model. If you want to successfully play the MLM “game”, you have to spend money so you look like you’re successfully playing the game.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Buying MLM Success</h3>



<p>Where this becomes even more risky is when you start buying the product yourself. Often, people do this because they haven’t met the quota to get the bonus check they need and it’s close to the end of the month. The math seems obvious. Your bonus is going to be $2,000, but you have to sell another $500 to get the bonus. If you spend the $500 yourself, you’ll get that bonus. In the end, you’ll be up by $1,500.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>You’re buying your rank, you’re buying your levels, you’re buying your bonus, and it can get really, really dangerous. </p>
<cite>Roberta Blevins</cite></blockquote>



<p>Many people say they would never do that. But then they get in a tight spot and they do it once. They push reality just a little bit. And it becomes easier and easier to do it again. Roberta has had people come on her podcast and talk about how they created an email address for their cat and signed their cat up for their MLM because they needed another account that month to qualify. You think it’s something you’ll never do. But if you’re in a position where you need that check, you start doing things out of desperation.</p>



<p>This is where MLMs have the potential to become exploitative or MLM scams. It’s easy to exploit people who are desperate for the check. In the end, the company gets their money, and they don’t really care if it comes from a customer or their own distributor. MLM scams can even set the quotas unreasonably high to get you to buy more and more with your own money each month to get the bonus check. People can end up spending more to qualify for the bonus than they get from the bonus.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The History of MLMs</h2>



<p>Multi-level marketing as a company structure got its start in the 1950s and 1960s. It was an era of prosperity after the fear and rationing of World War II, and a variety of cultural factors came together to produce the foundations of the MLM model. It started with door-to-door sales. The Fuller Brush guy, the Kirby vacuum salesperson, the Avon lady – they were all perfectly normal. It was direct sales, straight to the customer, and the salespeople brought the products directly to the housewives.</p>



<p>The MLM structure as we know it today came with a company called Holiday Magic. They were the first to add the multi-level structure to direct sales. Other companies liked the idea. Some MLMs were scams, more like ponzi schemes than multi-level marketing. But many were legitimate. In the 1960s, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accused MLM company Nutrilite of false advertising. Two of Nutrilite’s top sellers, Richard DeVos and Jay Van Andel, didn’t want to get in trouble with the FDA. They left Nutrilite and started their own MLM company, called American Way. Now, we know it as Amway.</p>



<p>In the 1960s and 1970s, an MLM company that sold makeup also ran into trouble with government agencies. Due to these issues, the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) made rules for MLMs. These rules were affectionately known as the “Koscot rules.” The Koscot rules determined what separated a legal MLM business from an illegal pyramid scheme. It declared legitimate businesses had at least 70% of the company’s products sold to people not associated with the company, for example. All MLMs had to follow the Koscot rules.</p>



<p>That is, until Amway.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Amway Rules</h3>



<p>Amway’s fight with the FTC started in 1975 and lasted four years. You can read the whole story in the book <em>Ponzinomics</em> by Robert Fitzpatrick. But the short version is that at one point, a judge who wasn’t affiliated with the case filled in for the day. He looked over the case and decided that Amway looked like a legitimate business to him.</p>



<p>That decision replaced the Koscot rules with a new set of rules known as the “Amway rules.” The Amway rules are really just a set of legal loopholes that protect MLM businesses and MLM scams alike. It allowed MLMs to proliferate in the 1980s. The more well-known MLM companies, like Amway, Shaklee, Mary Kay, Avon, and USANA, became big in the 1980s.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Regulation for MLMs</h2>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I know MLMs will never go away. I just want to regulate an unregulated industry because we’ve seen what deregulation does. </p>
<cite>Roberta Blevins</cite></blockquote>



<p>Roberta thinks it’s essential to regulate MLMs. We’ve seen the consequences of a lack of regulation in the financial industry, and even in what happened with the Titanic sub recently. Regulations keep everyone as safe as possible. They can help prevent MLM scams and protect people from predatory and unethical practices. That’s why Roberta works with regulatory agencies to create new rules and laws. It’s a popular industry. She just wants to make it safer.</p>



<p>The FTC has been working on some regulations. Last year, they reopened the business opportunity rule for a comment period. The business opportunity rule was created to regulate MLMs, but they successfully lobbied themselves out of complying. Since then, <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/how-not-to-get-scammed-on-gig-worker-sites-like-fiverr-and-upwork">gig work</a> has come up as a question as well. The comment period allowed people to tell the FTC if they want these regulations and why. They received thousands of comments.</p>



<p>Now, we’re between the states. There’s a lot of red tape in government. The first step is saying, “Here’s the question. Should we look more into this?” Everybody has said yes. So now, they’re thinking about looking into it. We’re waiting for them now.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>If we want MLMs to be legitimate and we want to legitimize them, we need to add rules and regulations. </p>
<cite>Roberta Blevins</cite></blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Real Numbers on MLMs</h2>



<p>With the effort most people are spending on their MLM, they could be making more money in a regular job somewhere else. Roberta actually did the math on this. She used the income disclosure statements of all the MLMs she could find. She did her calculations based on the annual averages that they provide.</p>



<p>On average, distributors made thirty-five to fifty cents an hour. That’s less than prison wages. But obviously, those numbers are skewed. Some people are making nothing, and some are making millions. And income disclosures only cover people participating in the bonus plans. Anyone who is a specacular seller but doesn’t have a team under them won’t show up on the disclosures.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Even the median number in a lot of these income disclosure statements is zero. … More than half of people [in MLMs] are making nothing. </p>
<cite>Roberta Blevins</cite></blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to Join an MLM Without Losing Everything</h2>



<p>When you’re looking at any business opportunity, you have to look at it financially. You need to know what math to do to find out if you’re making money off it and if so, how much. Roberta always says that numbers don’t lie. If you decide to join an MLM, treat it like a business, not a hobby.</p>



<p>When Roberta asks people in MLMs about their profit and loss, they usually don’t know what she’s talking about. That makes sense. They’re not businesspeople, they’re stay-at-home moms trying to make extra money. But if you’re going to do it as a business and try to make money, you need to calculate your profit and loss.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Track Everything</h3>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>If you’re going to be spending money or making money, you need to be tracking those [profit and loss] numbers, both of them. </p>
<cite>Roberta Blevins</cite></blockquote>



<p>The first step is to track everything. Track all the time you spend working on your MLM. If it’s fifteen minutes scrolling through Facebook looking for people to reach out to, record that fifteen minutes. If you’re doing it while cooking, taking care of your kids, or any other multitasking, write it down. A lot of people think about it as a part-time business and are shocked to realize they do it You need to know how much how much time you’re putting into your business because you’ll need that number for your math later.</p>



<p>Track your profit. Any commissions, anything you sold, any bonus checks you’re getting, that’s all profit. And track your losses. Losses are any fees or anything you pay for the month. Lots of MLMs have a website fee. If you pay $10 per month for your website, record that as a loss. Record any promotional stuff you buy, like business cards, Facebook advertising, or the babysitter you hired for three hours while you ran business-related errands. If you drive for your business, record the mileage. Record you bought for a party at your house and the cost of that book your upline said you must read. Record every single dollar that you spend on your business.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Do the Math</h3>



<p>Track your profit and loss for a month. Then calculate how much you gained or lost. You can do this by adding up all your profits and all your losses for the month, then subtracting your losses from your profits. This gives you your earnings. If your earnings are positive, you made money. If your earnings are negative, you lost money. From there, you can calculate how much money you made per hour. Divide your earnings by the number of hours you worked to get your hourly earnings.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1415850960-1024x683.jpg" alt="It's important to track all your income and expenses and calculate your profits and losses to ensure your MLM business is profitable." class="wp-image-6148" srcset="https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1415850960-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1415850960-300x200.jpg 300w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1415850960-768x512.jpg 768w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1415850960-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1415850960-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Check In Every Three Months</h3>



<p>Track everything and do the math for a month. Then do it again. At the end of three months, evaluate. In the first few months, people are usually pretty excited for you. The market is hot and happy to help you out, host parties, and do things. Chances are good that you will have some profits or at least break even in your first three months.</p>



<p>But don’t stop. Keep tracking the numbers and doing the math every month. After three more months, reevaluate. Are you still making money even after you subtract your losses? Does your hourly earnings seem reasonable? If you’re still in the green and want to continue, great.</p>



<p>But if during any of these evaluations you find that you’re losing money or spending ten hours a day hustling for less than a dollar an hour, that’s a sign that it’s time to quit. There’s no shame in quitting. In MLMs, there’s a 90% loss rate. Catching it early and getting out before you lose too much is wise. And doing this tracking can help you spot an MLM scam that will never be profitable quickly.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Check In With Your Team</h3>



<p>If you become really successful in your MLM and have a team underneath you, start checking in with them. Ask them if they’re successful. Teach them to do this same calculating that you’re doing. And if they’re in the red, encourage them to leave. There’s a morality aspect here. Most people just won’t be successful with MLMs. If you encourage them to buy more because they’re so close to success, you are lying to them and putting them into a terrible financial situation.</p>



<p>Roberta once encouraged one of her team members to pay her mortgage instead of buying more LuLaRoe. She missed out on a pretty big bonus check that she would have gotten from her team member’s purchase. But she couldn’t live with the fact that she would enjoy a steak dinner because one of her team gave her their mortgage payment. Some people can live with that. Roberta has talked to people who were in the 1% of top sellers and had incredible teams but have had to go to therapy to unpack some of the things they told their team to do.</p>



<p>One of her friends co-opted her own cancer to shill for her MLM. People don’t want to be singled out or make their upline upset. That’s where the cult-like element comes in. If you’re experiencing that, it’s time to get out. No legitimate sales job would reward you for buying the product yourself and storing it in your garage. If a company encourages you to buy your own product or to act against your morals to sell it, it’s time to get out.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Don’t ever fall for any of that rah-rah sisterhood. It isn’t real. Even though it looks and feels super, super real, I promise you it’s not real. </p>
<cite>Roberta Blevins</cite></blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Have an Anchor to Avoid MLM Scams</h2>



<p>If you really want to get involved in an MLM but want to keep yourself safe and avoid MLM scams, you need an anchor. An anchor is an unbiased person outside the situation. They need to be someone who will listen and is safe for you to talk to. They can even be anti-MLM. What’s important is that they have no skin in the game other than caring about you. Your anchor is the person you can – and should – go to when you have concerns, aren’t sure, or think you may be seeing red flags.</p>



<p>High-demand situations, like MLM scams and some MLMs, don’t want you to have an anchor outside the company. They want the person you go to to be your upline or someone else affiliated with the company. They will brand your anchor as “negative” or “unsupportive” and tell you to cut negative and unsupportive people out of your life. But there’s no high without a low, and no mountain without a valley. Trying to cut all negativity out of your life is impossible. And it will very easily isolate you in a dangerous or manipulative situation.</p>



<p>You deserve a safe space to air your grievances. And a company should be able to stand up to scrutiny. Your anchor person can serve both roles. They should be a safe place to discuss your complaints and concerns. And they can help you scrutinize a company and determine if it’s really safe and legitimate or actually an MLM scam.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Any sort of organization that is actively trying to silence anything that they consider negative is a very, very big red flag. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Back in 2021, we found out just how commonplace it was for Facebook to ban accounts. In just three months from October to December 2020, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/melissaholzberg/2021/03/22/facebook-banned-13-billion-accounts-over-three-months-to-combat-fake-and-harmful-content/?sh=647c2eb52150">1.3 BILLION accounts</a> were banned from Facebook because of what Meta described as “false” and “harmful” content.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And that doesn’t take into consideration any account banning that happened for other reasons, including abusive behavior, spamming other users, or violating the Community Standards in some other way.</p>



<p>Because it’s possible for Facebook to permanently ban you, let’s take a look at what you should avoid doing if you want to prevent a lifetime ban from the platform!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-facebook-bans-blocks-and-restricts-users">How Facebook Bans, Blocks, and Restricts Users</h2>



<p>Not every “ban” from Facebook is permanent. Meta has a <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/enforcement/taking-action/restricting-accounts/">number of options</a> at their disposal for how to handle content and accounts that they determine have violated their policies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Facebook documents most violations as a “strike” against your account. Here’s what Facebook does based on these strikes: </p>



<ul>
<li>1 strike: Nothing bad happens with 1 strike, but you will get a warning.&nbsp;</li>



<li>2-6 strikes: They will block you from some features for a set amount of time. Often, this limits you from posting in groups. </li>



<li>7 strikes: This leads to a 1-day restriction from all content creation, including: making posts, commenting on content, creating pages, etc.</li>



<li>8 strikes: At this stage, your account will be restricted from creating content for 3 days.</li>



<li>9 strikes: This last stage before a permanent restriction is a 7-day restriction from content creation</li>
</ul>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/82-1024x683.jpg" alt="Facebook login screen" class="wp-image-6162" srcset="https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/82-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/82-300x200.jpg 300w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/82-768x512.jpg 768w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/82.jpg 1199w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Counts as a Community Standards Violation?</h2>



<p>Facebook has extensive <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/?source=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fcommunitystandards">Community Standards.</a></p>



<p>Repeatedly violating these standards is the fastest way to get banned from Facebook. There are several categories of off-limit comments, posts, and content:</p>



<ul>
<li>Violence and Criminal Behavior (including but not limited to inciting violence, coordinating harm, promoting crime, committing fraud, selling restricted goods and services)</li>



<li>Safety issues (including but not limited to suicide, self-injury; crimes against children like sexual exploitation, abuse, and nudity; adult sexual exploitation; bullying and harassment; privacy violations, and other forms of human exploitation)</li>



<li>Objectionable content (hate speech, violent and graphic content, adult nudity and sexual activity, and sexual solicitation)</li>



<li>Integrity and Authenticity concerns (spam, cybersecurity, inauthentic behavior, misinformation, and memorialization of deceased account users)&nbsp;</li>



<li>Intellectual Property violations</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Where do Community Standards violations occur?</h3>



<p>You can get a Community Standards violation from original posts that you make, comments that you leave on other posts, activities in Facebook groups, and advertisements that you post.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Generally, simply sharing a post from another user that is later determined to have violated Meta’s Community Standards is not cause for your own violation. However, some serious violations may affect your account immediately.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Serious Violations Can Get You Banned?</h2>



<p>Some infractions may lead to more severe penalties. For example, Meta has a policy on <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/dangerous-individuals-organizations/">dangerous individuals and organizations</a>.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><em>In an effort to prevent and disrupt real-world harm, we do not allow organizations or individuals that proclaim a violent mission or are engaged in violence to have a presence on Facebook. We assess these entities based on their behavior both online and offline, most significantly, their ties to violence. Under this policy, we designate individuals, organizations, and networks of people. These designations are divided into three tiers that indicate the level of content enforcement, with Tier 1 resulting in the most extensive enforcement because we believe these entities have the most direct ties to offline harm.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Violations for <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/en-gb/policies/community-standards/sexual-exploitation-adults/">adult sexual exploitation</a> are another cause for escalated account restrictions.</p>



<p>Facebook explains:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><em>In an effort to create space for this conversation and promote a safe environment, we allow victims to share their experiences, but remove content that depicts, threatens or promotes sexual violence, sexual assault, or sexual exploitation. We also remove content that displays, advocates for or coordinates sexual acts with non-consenting parties to avoid facilitating non-consensual sexual acts.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Ahead of a permanent ban, they may limit you for a longer period of time, prevent you from using Facebook Live, or prohibit you from creating new ads – even for a first offense.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to Avoid Going to “Facebook Jail”</h2>



<p>Have you heard references to people being “thrown in Facebook Jail?”<br><br>Facebook Jail is just an unofficial name for getting slapped with one of those strikes that is associated with a restriction on your account.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are 2 kinds of Facebook Jail:</p>



<ol>
<li>A temporary restriction with a maximum period of 21 days</li>



<li>A permanent ban from Facebook, in which they permanently delete your account and you will never be able to access it again</li>
</ol>



<p>Here are the best ways to avoid going to Facebook Jail:</p>



<ol>
<li>Never create any content that promotes violence, criminal behavior, or hate speech of any kind</li>



<li>Avoid creating content that promotes misinformation&nbsp;</li>



<li>Avoid spamming people by making constant posts, sending out incessant friend requests to strangers, or tagging people all the time</li>



<li>Don’t bully or harass other users</li>



<li>Don’t use a fake name for your account</li>
</ol>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Can my Facebook page get restricted?</h3>



<p>So far, we’ve been talking about personal accounts–but what about professional pages?</p>



<p>There are several types of Facebook pages, other than just personal pages. These pages are for businesses, creators, public figures, organizations, non-profit organizations, politicians, and local shops and stores.</p>



<p>These kinds of pages can be affected by the same kinds of violations and restrictions as personal ones.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How to avoid getting your Facebook page restricted</h3>



<p>In general, the advice for protecting your page from violations penalties is similar to personal accounts. You want to avoid violent content, bullying, misinformation, spamming, or harassment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most importantly, you have to avoid anything that Facebook would consider to be spam or inauthentic content.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are 4 tips to avoid a restriction on the Facebook page you run for a business, organization, creator, public figure, etc:</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">1. Create your own original content and credit anyone whose work you share. </h4>



<p>Plagiarism is a problem on Facebook, and they have been trying to crack down on the problem. You may be able to get away with plagiarized content–but only if you are willing to be unethical <em>and</em> willing to risk Facebook banning you because of it. </p>



<p>For information about Meta’s approach to plagiarism, check out their info page on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/399224883474207">Intellectual Property.&nbsp;</a></p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">2. Don’t frequently post the same content to multiple pages. </h4>



<p>This can be a red flag for Facebook’s bots, who will perceive the behavior as spammy. If you need to post the same information to multiple pages, be sure to put some time between the posts.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">3. Don’t randomly tag a bunch of people or send follow requests in bulk. </h4>



<p>This is both spammy AND it makes your page look bad. People are unlikely to follow or interact with pages that randomly tag them or send them requests. You also run the risk of people reporting you as spam. Too many spam reports can equate to strikes against your account. </p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">4. Avoid looking like a bot.&nbsp;</h4>



<p>Inauthentic bot accounts will like and respond to posts in a ridiculously fast manner. If you frantically respond to posts and comment on them, that can make YOU look like a bot. Facebook could take action against your account for this kind of activity.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Two Things You Have to Do to Avoid Getting Banned from Facebook</h2>



<p>If you really want to avoid Facebook banning you, there are just two things you have to do. </p>



<p><strong>First, </strong>you have to know the rules and abide by them. Content that violates the Community Standards may not <em>always</em> get reported and noticed, but it is always a risk.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Second, </strong>pay attention to any warnings that you get. If you find yourself receiving violations, warnings, or temporary restrictions to your account, take note of them–and adjust your behavior.&nbsp;</p>
